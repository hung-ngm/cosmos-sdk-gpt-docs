This script is used to generate and combine Swagger files for the cosmos-sdk project. Swagger is a tool used for documenting RESTful APIs. 

The script first creates a directory called `tmp-swagger-gen` if it doesn't already exist. It then changes the current working directory to `proto`. The `proto_dirs` variable is set to the directories containing `.proto` files in the `cosmos` directory. 

The script then loops through each directory in `proto_dirs` and generates Swagger files for the `query.proto` and `service.proto` files using the `buf` tool. The generated Swagger files are saved in the `tmp-swagger-gen` directory.

After generating the Swagger files, the script changes the current working directory back to the root directory of the project and uses the `swagger-combine` tool to combine the individual Swagger files into a single file. The `config.json` file is used to specify the individual Swagger files to be combined. The combined Swagger file is saved in the `client/docs/swagger-ui` directory.

Finally, the script removes the `tmp-swagger-gen` directory.

This script is useful for generating and combining Swagger files for the cosmos-sdk project, which can then be used for documenting the project's RESTful APIs. Here is an example of how the generated Swagger file can be used:

```python
import requests
import json

# get the Swagger file
response = requests.get('http://localhost:8080/swagger.yaml')
swagger = response.content.decode('utf-8')

# parse the Swagger file
parsed_swagger = json.loads(swagger)

# print the API paths
for path in parsed_swagger['paths']:
    print(path)
```
