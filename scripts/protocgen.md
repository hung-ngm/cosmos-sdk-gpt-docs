The code is a bash script that generates gogo proto code for the cosmos-sdk project. Proto files are used to define the structure of messages that are sent between different parts of the system. The script first navigates to the `proto` directory and finds all the directories that contain proto files. It then iterates through each directory and generates gogo proto code for each proto file that does not have its `go_package` option set to `cosmossdk.io/api/...`. This is done to ensure that gogo proto files are only generated for proto files that are not natively built for `google.golang.org/protobuf`. The `buf generate` command is used to generate the gogo proto code based on the `buf.gen.gogo.yaml` template.

After generating the gogo proto code, the script generates codec/testdata proto code and baseapp test messages. It then moves the proto files to the appropriate directories and removes the temporary directories created during the generation process. Finally, the script runs `go mod tidy` to ensure that the go.mod file is up to date and runs `./scripts/protocgen-pulsar.sh` to generate pulsar proto code.

This script is used to generate gogo proto code for the cosmos-sdk project. The generated code is used to define the structure of messages that are sent between different parts of the system. The script is run manually by executing the `docker run` command after building the docker image using the `docker build` command. The generated code is used throughout the cosmos-sdk project to ensure that messages are properly structured and can be sent and received by different parts of the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script generates gogo proto code, codec/testdata proto code, and baseapp test messages for the cosmos-sdk project, and moves proto files to the right places.

2. Why is the regex checking for the go_package option set to cosmossdk.io/api/...?
   
   The regex checks if a proto file has its go_package set to cosmossdk.io/api/... because gogo proto files should only be generated if this is false. The script does not want gogo proto to run for proto files which are natively built for google.golang.org/protobuf.

3. What is the purpose of the `./scripts/protocgen-pulsar.sh` command at the end of the script?
   
   The purpose of the `./scripts/protocgen-pulsar.sh` command at the end of the script is not clear from the given code. It is likely a separate script that generates additional proto code for the cosmos-sdk project.
