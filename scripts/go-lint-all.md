This bash script is used to run a linter called `golangci-lint` on all modules within the `cosmos-sdk` project. The purpose of a linter is to analyze code for potential errors, bugs, or stylistic issues. 

The script first sets the `REPO_ROOT` variable to the root directory of the project. It then defines a function called `lint_module` which takes a root directory as an argument and runs `golangci-lint` on all modules within that directory. The `-c` flag specifies the configuration file for `golangci-lint`, which is located in the project's root directory. 

The script then uses the `find` command to locate all `go.mod` files within the project directory and its subdirectories. It passes each `go.mod` file to the `lint_module` function as an argument, along with any additional command-line arguments. The `export -f` command exports the `lint_module` function so that it can be used by the `xargs` command. 

Overall, this script is a useful tool for ensuring code quality within the `cosmos-sdk` project. It can be run periodically to catch potential issues early on in the development process. 

Example usage:
```
./scripts/lint.sh
```
This will run the linter on all modules within the project. Additional command-line arguments can be passed to the script to customize the linter's behavior.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used for linting Go modules in the `cosmos-sdk` project.

2. What is the significance of the `.golangci.yml` file?
   
   The `.golangci.yml` file is a configuration file used by the `golangci-lint` tool to specify linting rules and settings.

3. What is the expected output of running this script?
   
   The script will output the modules being linted and the date and time of the linting process. It will also run the `golangci-lint` tool on the specified modules using the configuration file and any additional command-line arguments provided.
