This script is used to generate protobuf files for the new google.golang.org/protobuf API. Protobuf is a language-agnostic binary serialization format developed by Google. It is used to serialize structured data for communication between different services. The protobuf files generated by this script are used in the cosmos-sdk project to define the messages that are sent between different modules of the system.

The script first installs the necessary dependencies for generating the protobuf files. It installs the protoc-gen-go-pulsar and protoc-gen-go-grpc tools, which are used to generate Go code from the protobuf files. The protoc-gen-go-pulsar tool is a custom plugin developed by the cosmos-sdk team that generates Pulsar-specific code from the protobuf files.

The script then cleans the API directory by deleting any existing protobuf files. It then generates the API module by running the buf generate command with the buf.gen.pulsar.yaml template. This generates the protobuf files for the API module.

Next, the script generates Pulsar test data by running the buf generate command with the buf.gen.pulsar.yaml template in the testutil/testdata directory. This generates the protobuf files for the test data.

Finally, the script generates the x/tx module by running the make codegen command in the x/tx directory. This generates the Go code for the x/tx module from the protobuf files.

Overall, this script is an important part of the cosmos-sdk project as it generates the protobuf files that define the messages sent between different modules of the system. These messages are used to communicate between different services and are an essential part of the system's functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    
    This script is for generating protobuf files for the new google.golang.org/protobuf API.

2. What dependencies are required for this script to run?
    
    This script requires the `cosmos-proto` and `grpc` packages to be installed.

3. What directories and files are affected by running this script?
    
    This script affects the `api` directory and deletes files with extensions `.pulsar.go`, `.pb.go`, `.cosmos_orm.go`, and `.pb.gw.go`. It also affects the `testutil/testdata` directory and generates Pulsar test data. Finally, it affects the `x/tx` directory and generates code.
