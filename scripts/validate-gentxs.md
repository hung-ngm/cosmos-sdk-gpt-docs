This script is used to validate and test the genesis file for a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain network. It ensures that the required environment variables are set and that the necessary dependencies are installed. The script then clones the specified GitHub repository, checks out the specified version, and installs the daemon. It then iterates over all the JSON files in the specified directory and validates each gentx file. 

The script first checks if Golang is installed and installs it if it is not. It then checks if the required environment variables are set and exits if any of them are missing. The required environment variables are `GH_URL`, `DAEMON`, `DENOM`, `GO_VERSION`, `CHAIN_ID`, `PRELAUNCH_GENESIS_URL`, and `GENTXS_DIR`. 

The script then clones the specified GitHub repository, checks out the specified version, and installs the daemon. It then iterates over all the JSON files in the specified directory and validates each gentx file. For each gentx file, the script initializes a testnet, adds a random validator key, fetches the genesis file, and validates the gentx. If the gentx is valid, the script starts the node and checks the network status. If the network status check fails, the script assumes that the gentx is invalid and exits. 

This script is useful for validating and testing the genesis file for a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain network. It ensures that the gentx files are valid and that the network is functioning properly. 

Example usage:

```
GH_URL=https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
DAEMON=simd
CHAIN_ID=testnet-1
DENOM=ustake
BINARY_VERSION=v0.44.0
GO_VERSION=1.17
PRELAUNCH_GENESIS_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/master/$CHAIN_ID/genesis-prelaunch.json
GENTXS_DIR=$GOPATH/github.com/cosmos/mainnet/$CHAIN_ID/gentxs

./validate-gentxs.sh
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used to install and configure a Cosmos SDK validator node for a testnet.

2. What are the required environment variables that need to be set before running this script?
   
   The required environment variables that need to be set before running this script are `DAEMON`, `CHAIN_ID`, `DENOM`, `GH_URL`, `BINARY_VERSION`, `GO_VERSION`, `PRELAUNCH_GENESIS_URL`, and `GENTXS_DIR`.

3. What does this script do if the `GENTXS_DIR` is empty?
   
   If the `GENTXS_DIR` is empty, the script will print a message saying that there is nothing to validate.
