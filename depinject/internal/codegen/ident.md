The `codegen` package contains code generation utilities for the `cosmos-sdk` project. The `CreateIdent` function generates a new identifier that is unique across the entire file. This is useful for generating code that does not conflict with reserved symbols, top-level declarations, and other defined identifiers.

The `CreateIdent` function takes a `namePrefix` string as input and returns a new `ast.Ident` object. The `namePrefix` string is used as the prefix for the generated identifier. The `doCreateIdent` function is called internally by `CreateIdent` to generate the actual identifier string.

The `doCreateIdent` function takes a `namePrefix` string as input and returns a string that represents a unique identifier. It does this by appending a number to the `namePrefix` string until a unique identifier is found. The `idents` map is used to keep track of which identifiers have already been generated.

This code is used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to generate code that is unique and does not conflict with existing code. For example, it may be used to generate new variable names or function names when generating code dynamically. Here is an example usage of the `CreateIdent` function:

```
func generateCode() {
    fileGen := &FileGen{}
    ident := fileGen.CreateIdent("myVar")
    fmt.Println(ident.Name)
}
```

This code creates a new `FileGen` object and generates a new identifier with the prefix "myVar". The generated identifier is then printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a part of the `codegen` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project. It provides a method to create a new identifier that is unique across the whole file and doesn't conflict with reserved symbols, top-level declarations, and other defined idents.

2. What is the input and output of the `CreateIdent` method?
   - The `CreateIdent` method takes a `namePrefix` string as input and returns a pointer to an `ast.Ident` object as output.

3. How does the `doCreateIdent` method ensure that the created identifier is unique?
   - The `doCreateIdent` method uses a loop to generate a new identifier by appending a number to the `namePrefix` string until it finds a unique identifier that doesn't exist in the `idents` map. The `idents` map keeps track of all the identifiers that have been created in the file so far.
