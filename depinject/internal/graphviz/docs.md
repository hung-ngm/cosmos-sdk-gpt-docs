The `graphviz` package provides a set of simple types for building graphviz DOT files. These files are commonly used for container debugging and visualization. The package does not attempt to cover all of graphviz, but rather focuses on the specific needs of the project.

The purpose of this package is to provide a convenient way to generate graphviz DOT files for container debugging. The types provided by the package allow users to easily create nodes and edges in the graph, and to specify their attributes such as color, shape, and label.

For example, the `Node` type represents a node in the graph and has attributes such as `ID`, `Label`, and `Shape`. Users can create a new node by calling the `NewNode` function and passing in the desired attributes:

```go
node := NewNode("node1", "Node 1", "box")
```

Similarly, the `Edge` type represents an edge in the graph and has attributes such as `From`, `To`, and `Label`. Users can create a new edge by calling the `NewEdge` function and passing in the desired attributes:

```go
edge := NewEdge("node1", "node2", "Edge 1")
```

Once nodes and edges have been created, users can add them to a `Graph` object and generate a DOT file by calling the `Generate` method:

```go
graph := NewGraph()
graph.AddNode(node)
graph.AddEdge(edge)
dot := graph.Generate()
```

The resulting `dot` variable contains the generated DOT file, which can be written to a file or used for further processing.

Overall, the `graphviz` package provides a simple and convenient way to generate graphviz DOT files for container debugging in the larger cosmos-sdk project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this package and what does it do?
- This package provides types for building graphviz DOT files for container debugging purposes.

2. What is graphviz and how is it related to this package?
- Graphviz is a visualization software and this package provides a simplified implementation of it for container debugging purposes.

3. Are there any limitations or considerations to keep in mind when using this package?
- The package only covers what is needed for container debugging and does not attempt to cover all of graphviz. Developers should keep this in mind when using the package for other purposes.
