The `depinject` package provides a dependency injection framework for Go. The `In` and `Out` structs can be embedded in other structs to specify dependencies and outputs, respectively. This allows for a more flexible way of specifying dependencies and outputs than using positional parameters or return values. 

The `expandStructArgsProvider` function takes a `providerDescriptor` and expands any embedded `In` or `Out` structs into separate inputs or outputs. It does this by calling `expandStructArgsFn` to create a new function that takes the expanded inputs and returns the expanded outputs. 

The `expandStructArgsFn` function takes a `providerDescriptor` and returns a new function that takes an array of `reflect.Value` inputs, expands any embedded `In` structs, calls the original function with the expanded inputs, and then expands any embedded `Out` structs in the return values. 

The `structArgsInTypes` function takes a `reflect.Type` and returns an array of `providerInput`s for any embedded `In` structs. It also supports an optional `optional` tag that can be used to mark a dependency as optional. 

The `expandStructArgsOutTypes` function takes an array of `providerOutput`s and expands any embedded `Out` structs into separate outputs. It does this by calling `structArgsOutTypes` to create an array of `providerOutput`s for the embedded `Out` structs. 

The `structArgsOutTypes` function takes a `reflect.Type` and returns an array of `providerOutput`s for any embedded `Out` structs. 

The `buildIn` function takes a `reflect.Type` and an array of `reflect.Value` inputs, and returns a new `reflect.Value` that is a struct with the embedded `In` fields set to the corresponding values from the input array. 

The `extractFromOut` function takes a `reflect.Type` and a `reflect.Value` output, and returns an array of `reflect.Value`s for any non-embedded `Out` fields in the output. 

Overall, this package provides a way to use structs to specify dependencies and outputs in a more flexible way than using positional parameters or return values. It does this by expanding any embedded `In` or `Out` structs into separate inputs or outputs, respectively. This allows for a more modular and maintainable approach to dependency injection.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `In` and `Out` structs?
- The `In` struct is used to inform the container that the fields of the struct should be treated as dependency inputs, while the `Out` struct is used to inform the container that the fields of the struct should be treated as dependency outputs.
2. What is the purpose of the `expandStructArgsProvider` function?
- The `expandStructArgsProvider` function is used to expand the provider descriptor by checking if the inputs or outputs contain struct arguments, and if so, it replaces them with their individual fields.
3. What is the purpose of the `buildIn` function?
- The `buildIn` function is used to build an `In` struct by setting its fields to the corresponding values in the `values` slice.
