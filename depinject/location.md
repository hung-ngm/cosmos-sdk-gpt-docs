This file contains code related to dependency injection in the cosmos-sdk project. The `Location` interface and `location` struct are defined to represent the location of a function in the codebase. The `LocationFromPC` function takes a program counter (PC) value and returns a `Location` object representing the function at that location. The `LocationFromCaller` function is a convenience function that returns the `Location` of the calling function.

The `String` method returns a string representation of the `Location` object. The `Name` method returns the fully qualified function name. The `Format` method implements the `fmt.Formatter` interface for `Location`, printing a single-line representation for `%v` and a multi-line one for `%+v`.

The `splitFuncName` function is a helper function that takes a function name and returns the package name and function name. It handles vendored packages and URL-encoded package names.

Overall, this code provides functionality for working with function locations in the cosmos-sdk project. It can be used for debugging and logging purposes, as well as for dependency injection. For example, it could be used to automatically inject dependencies into functions based on their location in the codebase.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Location` interface and its associated methods?
- The `Location` interface defines methods for getting the name, package, file, and line number of a function. It is implemented by the `location` struct.

2. What is the purpose of the `splitFuncName` function?
- The `splitFuncName` function takes a fully qualified function name and returns the package name and function name. It handles cases where the package name is vendored or URL-encoded.

3. What is the purpose of the `LocationFromPC` and `LocationFromCaller` functions?
- The `LocationFromPC` function takes a program counter value and returns a `Location` object representing the function at that address. The `LocationFromCaller` function returns a `Location` object representing the function that called it, with an optional number of stack frames to skip.
