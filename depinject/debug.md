The `depinject` package provides functionality for dependency injection in Go. This file contains code for debugging and visualization of the dependency injection container. The `DebugOption` interface is defined, which is a functional option for running a container that controls debug logging and visualization output. The `DebugOption` interface has several implementations such as `StdoutLogger`, `StderrLogger`, `FileLogger`, `Visualizer`, `LogVisualizer`, `FileVisualizer`, `Logger`, `OnError`, `OnSuccess`, `DebugCleanup`, `Debug`, `AutoDebug`, and `DebugOptions`. These implementations provide different options for logging and visualizing the dependency injection container. 

The `Debug` function is a default debug option that sends log output to stderr, dumps the container in the graphviz DOT and SVG formats to `debug_container.dot` and `debug_container.svg` respectively. The `AutoDebug` function does the same thing as `Debug` when there is an error and deletes the `debug_container.dot` if it exists when there is no error. The `DebugOptions` function bundles together other debug options. 

The `debugConfig` struct contains fields for logging, graphing, and extra processing. The `newDebugConfig` function initializes a new `debugConfig` struct. The `indentLogger` and `dedentLogger` functions are used to indent and dedent log messages. The `generateGraph` function generates a graph of the container in the Graphiz DOT format. The `locationGraphNode` function creates a graph node for a location. The `typeGraphNode` function creates a graph node for a type. The `moduleSubGraph` function creates a subgraph for a module. The `addGraphEdge` function adds an edge to the graph. 

Overall, this code provides functionality for debugging and visualizing the dependency injection container. It can be used to aid in the development and testing of the container.
