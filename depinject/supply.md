The `depinject` package contains code related to dependency injection in the Cosmos SDK project. This specific file defines a type called `supplyResolver` which implements the `resolver` interface. The purpose of this type is to provide a value for a specific type during dependency injection.

The `supplyResolver` type has four methods. The `getType()` method returns the type that this resolver is responsible for. The `describeLocation()` method returns a string representation of the location where the value is supplied from. The `addNode()` method is used to add a node to the dependency graph when a provider is added to the container. Finally, the `resolve()` method is called to retrieve the value for the type that this resolver is responsible for.

The `resolve()` method simply returns the value that was previously set for this resolver. The `addNode()` method is not used in this implementation and simply returns an error indicating that a duplicate definition was found. The `getType()` and `describeLocation()` methods are used to provide information about the resolver when debugging or logging.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the dependency injection system in the Cosmos SDK project. It allows for values to be supplied for specific types during runtime, which is a key feature of dependency injection. Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```go
// Define a type that needs to be injected
type MyType struct {
    SomeValue string
}

// Create a container and add a value for MyType
c := NewContainer()
c.Provide(MyType{}, SupplyValue(MyType{"Hello World"}))

// Retrieve an instance of MyType from the container
var myInstance MyType
err := c.Resolve(&myInstance)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Use the instance of MyType
fmt.Println(myInstance.SomeValue) // Output: "Hello World"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `depinject` package and what is its relationship to the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `depinject` package is used for dependency injection and is part of the `cosmos-sdk` project.
2. What is the `supplyResolver` struct and what methods does it have?
- The `supplyResolver` struct has fields for a type, value, location, and graph node, and has methods for getting the type, describing the location, adding a node, and resolving the value.
3. What is the `graphviz` package and how is it used in this file?
- The `graphviz` package is used internally by the `depinject` package and is imported at the top of the file. It is used to create a graph node for the `supplyResolver` type.
