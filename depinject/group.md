The `depinject` package provides a dependency injection framework for the Cosmos SDK project. This package contains a set of functions and types that allow developers to define and manage dependencies between different parts of the codebase.

The `ManyPerContainerType` interface is a marker interface that indicates that a type should be treated as a "many-per-container" type. This means that multiple instances of the type can be created and managed within a single container. For example, if `T` is a many-per-container type, then `[]T` can be declared as an output parameter for providers as many times as desired within the container. All of the provided values for `T` can be retrieved by declaring an `[]T` input parameter.

The `groupResolver` and `sliceGroupResolver` types are used to manage the resolution of many-per-container types within the container. These types keep track of the providers that have been registered for a given many-per-container type, and provide a way to retrieve all of the provided values for that type.

The `isManyPerContainerType` and `isManyPerContainerSliceType` functions are used to determine whether a given type is a many-per-container type or a slice of many-per-container types, respectively.

The `graphviz` package is used to generate a graph visualization of the dependency graph for the container. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the relationships between different parts of the codebase.

Overall, the `depinject` package provides a powerful and flexible way to manage dependencies within the Cosmos SDK project. By using this package, developers can easily define and manage complex dependencies between different parts of the codebase, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ManyPerContainerType` interface and how is it used?
   
   The `ManyPerContainerType` interface is used to mark a type that can be grouped together and declared as output parameters for providers as many times within the container as desired. All of the provided values for the type can be retrieved by declaring an `[]T` input parameter.

2. What is the difference between `groupResolver` and `sliceGroupResolver`?
   
   `groupResolver` is used for resolving a many-per-container type, while `sliceGroupResolver` is used for resolving a slice of many-per-container types.

3. What is the purpose of the `IsManyPerContainerType` function?
   
   The `IsManyPerContainerType` function is a marker function that just indicates that a type is a many-per-container type.
