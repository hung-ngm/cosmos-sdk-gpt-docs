The `depinject` package contains a single function called `isExportedType`. This function takes a `reflect.Type` as input and returns an error if the type is not exported or if it comes from an internal package. The purpose of this function is to ensure that only exported types from non-internal packages are used in dependency injection.

Dependency injection is a technique used in software engineering to manage dependencies between components of a system. It allows components to be loosely coupled, making it easier to modify and test individual components without affecting the rest of the system. In Go, dependency injection is often implemented using interfaces and constructor functions.

The `isExportedType` function is used to validate the types of constructor function arguments. Constructor functions are functions that create and return instances of a particular type. They are often used in dependency injection to create instances of components that depend on other components.

For example, consider the following constructor function:

```
func NewFoo(bar Bar) *Foo {
    return &Foo{bar: bar}
}
```

This function takes an argument of type `Bar` and returns a pointer to a new instance of `Foo`. Before calling this function, we can use `isExportedType` to ensure that `Bar` is an exported type from a non-internal package:

```
err := isExportedType(reflect.TypeOf(bar))
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

If `Bar` is not an exported type or comes from an internal package, an error will be returned. This helps to ensure that only valid types are used in dependency injection.

In summary, the `isExportedType` function is a utility function used in dependency injection to validate the types of constructor function arguments. It ensures that only exported types from non-internal packages are used in dependency injection, helping to maintain loose coupling between components.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `isExportedType` function?
- The `isExportedType` function checks if a given type is exported and not in an internal package. It returns an error if the type is not exported or comes from an internal package.

2. Why are generic type parameters not checked in the `isExportedType` function?
- Generic type parameters are not checked because it would involve complex parsing of type names, and there is no reflect API for generic type parameters. Parsing of these parameters should be possible in the future, but care should be taken to be exhaustive and cover all cases like pointers, maps, chans, etc.

3. What types of errors can the `isExportedType` function return?
- The `isExportedType` function can return two types of errors: `type must be exported` if the type is not exported, and `type must not come from an internal package` if the type comes from an internal package.
