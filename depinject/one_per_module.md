The `depinject` package provides dependency injection functionality for the Cosmos SDK project. This specific file, `one_per_module.go`, contains code related to types that can have up to one value per module. These types are marked with the `OnePerModuleType` interface, which includes a single method `IsOnePerModuleType()` that serves as a marker function.

The purpose of this file is to provide a resolver for one-per-module types. The resolver is responsible for retrieving all values of a one-per-module type and their respective modules. This is done by declaring an input parameter of type `map[string]T`, where `T` is the one-per-module type. The resolver is implemented as a struct called `onePerModuleResolver`, which contains a map of providers for each module, an index map to keep track of the order of providers, and a boolean flag to indicate whether the values have been resolved. 

The `isOnePerModuleType` function checks whether a given type implements the `OnePerModuleType` interface. The `isOnePerModuleMapType` function checks whether a given type is a map with string keys and values that implement the `OnePerModuleType` interface.

The `mapOfOnePerModuleResolver` struct is a wrapper around the `onePerModuleResolver` struct that provides a resolver for the `map[string]T` input parameter type. The `resolve` method of this struct logs the providers for each module, resolves the values for each provider, and returns a map of values for the one-per-module type.

The `addNode` method of the `onePerModuleResolver` struct adds a provider to the map of providers and index map. It checks whether the provider's module key is defined and whether there is already a provider for the same module. If there is already a provider for the same module, an error is returned.

Overall, this file provides a resolver for one-per-module types that can be used in the larger Cosmos SDK project to manage dependencies between modules. An example usage of this resolver would be to retrieve all instances of a specific type across all modules in the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `OnePerModuleType` interface and how is it used?
   
   The `OnePerModuleType` interface marks a type that can have up to one value per module, and it is used to retrieve all the values for a one-per-module type T and their respective modules by declaring an input parameter `map[string]T`.

2. What is the `onePerModuleResolver` struct and how is it used?
   
   The `onePerModuleResolver` struct is used to resolve dependencies for one-per-module types. It contains information about the type, map type, providers, index map, and whether it has been resolved or not. It also has methods to add a node, describe the location, and resolve the dependencies.

3. What is the purpose of the `mapOfOnePerModuleResolver` struct and how is it different from `onePerModuleResolver`?
   
   The `mapOfOnePerModuleResolver` struct is used to resolve a map of one-per-module types. It is a wrapper around `onePerModuleResolver` and has a method to resolve the dependencies for the map. The main difference is that it is used for maps of one-per-module types, while `onePerModuleResolver` is used for individual one-per-module types.
