The `depinject` package provides a dependency injection framework for the Cosmos SDK project. The package contains error definitions and helper functions for handling errors related to dependency injection.

The `ErrMultipleImplicitInterfaceBindings` type is an error that is returned when an attempt is made to implicitly bind an interface to a concrete type, but the container is unable to resolve the binding because multiple matches are found. This error contains the interface type and a list of the matching types that caused the ambiguity.

The `ErrNoTypeForExplicitBindingFound` type is an error that is returned when an explicit binding is specified from an interface to an implementation, but the container is unable to find a provider for the requested implementation. This error contains the implementation and interface names, as well as an optional module name.

The `duplicateDefinitionError` function is a helper function that returns an error message when a duplicate definition is found for a given type. This function takes the type, the location of the duplicate definition, and the location of the existing definition as arguments.

These error definitions and helper functions are used throughout the Cosmos SDK project to provide meaningful error messages when dependency injection errors occur. For example, if a module attempts to bind an interface to a concrete type, but multiple matches are found, the `ErrMultipleImplicitInterfaceBindings` error will be returned with the list of matching types. Similarly, if a module attempts to bind an interface to an implementation, but no provider is found, the `ErrNoTypeForExplicitBindingFound` error will be returned with the relevant information.

Overall, the `depinject` package plays an important role in the Cosmos SDK project by providing a robust and flexible dependency injection framework that allows modules to be easily composed and tested.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this file and what package does it belong to?
- This file is part of the `cosmos-sdk` project and belongs to the `depinject` package. It provides error definitions and functions related to dependency injection.

2. What is the difference between `ErrMultipleImplicitInterfaceBindings` and `ErrNoTypeForExplicitBindingFound`?
- `ErrMultipleImplicitInterfaceBindings` is an error that occurs when there are multiple matches for an implicit interface binding, while `ErrNoTypeForExplicitBindingFound` is an error that occurs when there is no provider for a requested implementation in an explicit interface binding.

3. What is the purpose of the `duplicateDefinitionError` function?
- The `duplicateDefinitionError` function returns an error message indicating that there is a duplicate provision of a type by two different locations.
