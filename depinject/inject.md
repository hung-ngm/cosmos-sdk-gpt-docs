The `depinject` package provides a dependency injection framework for the Cosmos SDK project. The `Inject` function is the main entry point for building and running a dependency injection container. It takes a `Config` object and a list of output pointers as arguments. The `Config` object specifies the providers that will be registered with the container, and the output pointers specify the values that will be extracted from the container. The `Inject` function returns an error if any of the requested outputs cannot be provided by the container.

The `InjectDebug` function is a version of `Inject` that takes an optional `DebugOption` argument for logging and visualization. The `inject` function is the internal implementation of `Inject` and `InjectDebug`. It takes a `Location` object, a `DebugOption` object, a `Config` object, and a list of output pointers as arguments. It returns an error if any of the requested outputs cannot be provided by the container.

The `doInject` function is called by `inject` to perform the actual injection. It takes a `debugConfig` object, a `Location` object, a `DebugOption` object, a `Config` object, and a list of output pointers as arguments. It registers the providers specified by the `Config` object with a new container, and then builds the container to extract the requested outputs. If any errors occur during the injection process, they are logged and returned.

Overall, the `depinject` package provides a flexible and extensible dependency injection framework that can be used throughout the Cosmos SDK project to manage dependencies between components. Developers can use the `Inject` function to build and run a container, and the `Config` object to specify the providers that will be registered with the container. The `DebugOption` object can be used to enable verbose debugging information if needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Inject` function?
    
    The `Inject` function is the single entry point for building and running a dependency injection container. It builds the container specified by `containerConfig` and extracts the requested outputs from the container or returns an error.

2. What is the difference between `Inject` and `InjectDebug` functions?
    
    `InjectDebug` is a version of `Inject` which takes an optional `DebugOption` for logging and visualization. It provides verbose debugging information if there is an error and nothing upon success, whereas `Inject` uses the debug mode provided by `AutoDebug`.

3. What is the purpose of the `doInject` function?
    
    The `doInject` function registers providers, builds a container, and extracts the requested outputs from the container or returns an error. It is called by the `Inject` and `InjectDebug` functions.
