The `App` struct is a wrapper around `BaseApp` and `ModuleManager` that can be used in hybrid app.go/app config scenarios or directly as a `servertypes.Application` instance. It is used to create a hybrid app.go setup where some configuration is done declaratively with an app config and the rest of it is done the old way. 

The `App` struct has several methods that are used to register and load modules, initialize the chain, and register API and gRPC routes. 

The `RegisterModules` method registers the provided modules with the module manager and the basic module manager. This is the primary hook for integrating with modules which are not registered using the app config.

The `Load` method finishes all initialization operations and loads the app. It sets the order of initialization, export genesis, begin blockers, end blockers, and migrations. 

The `BeginBlocker` and `EndBlocker` methods update the application every begin and end block, respectively. 

The `InitChainer` method initializes the chain. It unmarshals the app state bytes and returns the module manager's `InitGenesis` method. 

The `RegisterAPIRoutes` method registers all application module routes with the provided API server. It registers new tx routes from grpc-gateway, new CometBFT queries routes from grpc-gateway, node gRPC service for grpc-gateway, and grpc-gateway routes for all modules.

The `RegisterTxService`, `RegisterTendermintService`, and `RegisterNodeService` methods register the transaction, Tendermint, and node gRPC services, respectively.

The `Configurator` method returns the app's configurator.

The `LoadHeight` method loads a particular height.

The `DefaultGenesis` method returns a default genesis from the registered `AppModuleBasic`'s.

The `GetStoreKeys` method returns all the stored store keys.

The `SetInitChainer` method sets the init chainer function. It wraps `BaseApp.SetInitChainer` to allow setting a custom init chainer from an app.

The `UnsafeFindStoreKey` method fetches a registered `StoreKey` from the App in linear time. This should only be used in testing.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `App` struct and how is it used?
- The `App` struct is a wrapper around `BaseApp` and `ModuleManager` that can be used as a `servertypes.Application` instance. It can be used to create a hybrid app setup where some configuration is done declaratively with an app config and the rest is done the old way.

2. What is the purpose of the `RegisterModules` function and how is it used?
- The `RegisterModules` function registers the provided modules with the module manager and the basic module manager. It is the primary hook for integrating with modules which are not registered using the app config.

3. What is the purpose of the `Load` function and what does it do?
- The `Load` function finishes all initialization operations and loads the app. It sets up the order of execution for various app functions like `InitGenesis`, `ExportGenesis`, `BeginBlocker`, and `EndBlocker`. It also loads the latest version of the app if `loadLatest` is set to true.
