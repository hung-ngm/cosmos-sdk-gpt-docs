The `ormtable` package contains an interface called `Iterator` and several functions that implement this interface. The `Iterator` interface is used for iterating over indexes. The `prefixIterator` function takes a `kv.ReadonlyStore`, a `ReadBackend`, a `concreteIndex`, a `*ormkv.KeyCodec`, a prefix, and a list of options. It returns an `Iterator` and an error. The `rangeIterator` function is similar to `prefixIterator`, but it takes a start and end key instead of a prefix. Both functions return an `Iterator` that can be used to iterate over the index.

The `Iterator` interface has several methods that must be implemented by any type that implements the interface. The `Next` method advances the iterator and returns true if a valid entry is found. The `Keys` method returns the current index key and primary key values that the iterator points to. The `UnmarshalMessage` method unmarshals the entry the iterator currently points to the provided proto.Message. The `GetMessage` method retrieves the proto.Message that the iterator currently points to. The `Cursor` method returns the cursor referencing the current iteration position and can be used to restart iteration right after this position. The `PageResponse` method returns a non-nil page response after `Next()` returns false if pagination was requested in list options. The `Close` method closes the iterator and must always be called when done using the iterator.

The `indexIterator` type implements the `Iterator` interface. It has a `concreteIndex`, a `ReadBackend`, and a `kv.Iterator`. It also has an `indexValues` field, a `primaryKey` field, a `value` field, and a `started` field. The `indexValues` field is a slice of `protoreflect.Value` that contains the index values. The `primaryKey` field is a slice of `protoreflect.Value` that contains the primary key values. The `value` field is a byte slice that contains the value of the current entry. The `started` field is a boolean that indicates whether the iterator has started iterating.

The `prefixIterator` and `rangeIterator` functions return an `Iterator` that is implemented by the `indexIterator` type. The `indexIterator` type has methods that implement the `Iterator` interface. The `prefixIterator` and `rangeIterator` functions are used to iterate over indexes in the `cosmos-sdk` project. For example, the `prefixIterator` function is used in the `cosmos-sdk/x/staking/keeper/keeper.go` file to iterate over validators.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `prefixIterator` and `rangeIterator` functions?
- These functions define iterators for iterating over indexes with a given prefix or within a given range, respectively.

2. What is the purpose of the `applyCommonIteratorOptions` function?
- This function applies common options to an iterator, such as filtering, pagination, and limiting.

3. What is the purpose of the `Iterator` interface and its methods?
- The `Iterator` interface defines methods for iterating over indexes, including advancing to the next entry, retrieving the current index key and primary key values, unmarshaling the current entry into a proto message, and closing the iterator.
