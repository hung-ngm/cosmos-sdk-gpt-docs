The `ormtable` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project defines interfaces and implementations for tables and indexes. Tables are used to store data in a structured format, while indexes are used to efficiently retrieve data from tables based on specific criteria.

The `ormtable` package provides a set of interfaces that define the basic functionality of tables and indexes. These interfaces include `Table`, `Index`, `PrimaryKey`, and `SecondaryKey`. The `Table` interface defines methods for creating, updating, and deleting records in a table. The `Index` interface defines methods for querying records based on specific criteria. The `PrimaryKey` and `SecondaryKey` interfaces define methods for defining primary and secondary keys for a table.

In addition to the interfaces, the `ormtable` package also provides a set of implementations for these interfaces. These implementations include `SimpleTable`, `SimpleIndex`, `SimplePrimaryKey`, and `SimpleSecondaryKey`. These implementations provide a simple, straightforward way to create and manage tables and indexes.

Here is an example of how the `SimpleTable` implementation can be used to create a table:

```
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

table := ormtable.NewSimpleTable("people", &Person{})
err := table.Create()
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

In this example, a new `SimpleTable` instance is created with the name "people" and the `Person` struct as the record type. The `Create` method is then called to create the table in the database.

Overall, the `ormtable` package provides a flexible and extensible way to define and manage tables and indexes in the `cosmos-sdk` project.
