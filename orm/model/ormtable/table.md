The `ormtable` package contains interfaces and abstract types for defining and interacting with tables in a key-value store. The package is part of the larger `cosmos-sdk` project, which is a framework for building blockchain applications.

The `View` interface defines a read-only table and extends the `Index` interface. It provides methods for checking if an entity exists in the table, retrieving an entity by its primary key, and accessing indexes associated with the table. The `Table` interface extends `View` and adds methods for saving, inserting, updating, and deleting entities in the table. It also provides methods for importing and exporting JSON data and for retrieving the table's ID within its schema.

The `Schema` interface defines a container for tables and provides methods for encoding and decoding key-value pairs. It also provides a method for retrieving a table by its associated message type.

The `AutoIncrementTable` interface extends `Table` and adds methods for inserting entities with auto-incrementing primary keys and retrieving the sequence number of the last inserted entity.

Overall, this package provides a flexible and extensible way to define and interact with tables in a key-value store. It allows developers to define custom indexes and to easily import and export data in JSON format. The `AutoIncrementTable` interface provides a convenient way to work with tables that have auto-incrementing primary keys.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `View` interface and how does it differ from the `Table` interface?
- The `View` interface defines a read-only table and provides methods for retrieving data from the table. The `Table` interface extends the `View` interface and adds methods for modifying the table, such as inserting, updating, and deleting entries.

2. What is the purpose of the `AutoIncrementTable` interface and how does it differ from the `Table` interface?
- The `AutoIncrementTable` interface extends the `Table` interface and adds methods for working with tables that have auto-incrementing primary keys. These methods include `InsertReturningPKey` for inserting an entry and returning the newly generated primary key, and `LastInsertedSequence` for retrieving the sequence number of the last entry inserted into the table.

3. What is the purpose of the `Schema` interface and how does it relate to the `Table` interface?
- The `Schema` interface is an interface for things that contain tables and can encode and decode kv-store pairs. It extends the `EntryCodec` interface, which provides methods for encoding and decoding entries. The `Schema` interface includes a method `GetTable` that returns the table for the provided message type or nil. The `Table` interface extends the `View` interface and provides methods for modifying the table, so the `Schema` interface provides a way to access and modify tables through a higher-level interface.
