The `ormtable` package provides two interfaces for table hooks that can be used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project. These interfaces are `ValidateHooks` and `WriteHooks`.

The `ValidateHooks` interface defines methods that can be used to intercept insert, update, and delete operations and return an error if necessary. The methods in this interface are `ValidateInsert`, `ValidateUpdate`, and `ValidateDelete`. The `ValidateInsert` method is called before a message is inserted, and if an error is returned, the insertion will fail. The `ValidateUpdate` method is called before an existing message is updated with a new one, and if an error is returned, the update will fail. The `ValidateDelete` method is called before a message is deleted, and if an error is returned, the deletion will fail.

The `WriteHooks` interface defines methods that can be used to listen to insertions, updates, and deletes after they are written to the store. This can be used for indexing state in another database. The methods in this interface are `OnInsert`, `OnUpdate`, and `OnDelete`. The `OnInsert` method is called after a message is inserted into the store. The `OnUpdate` method is called after an entity is updated in the store. The `OnDelete` method is called after an entity is deleted from the store.

These interfaces can be implemented by other packages in the `cosmos-sdk` project to provide custom validation and indexing logic for the ORM tables. For example, a package that provides a custom database implementation could implement the `WriteHooks` interface to index state in that database. Here is an example implementation of the `ValidateHooks` interface:

```
type MyValidateHooks struct{}

func (h *MyValidateHooks) ValidateInsert(ctx context.Context, msg proto.Message) error {
    // custom validation logic here
    return nil
}

func (h *MyValidateHooks) ValidateUpdate(ctx context.Context, existing, new proto.Message) error {
    // custom validation logic here
    return nil
}

func (h *MyValidateHooks) ValidateDelete(ctx context.Context, msg proto.Message) error {
    // custom validation logic here
    return nil
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this package and what does it do?
- This package defines two interfaces, `ValidateHooks` and `WriteHooks`, which can be used to intercept and validate insert, update, and delete operations on a table.

2. What is the expected input and output of the methods defined in `ValidateHooks`?
- The `ValidateInsert`, `ValidateUpdate`, and `ValidateDelete` methods all take a `context.Context` and a `proto.Message` as input, and return an error. The `ValidateInsert` method is called before a message is inserted, `ValidateUpdate` is called before an existing message is updated with a new one, and `ValidateDelete` is called before a message is deleted.

3. What is the purpose of the `WriteHooks` interface and how is it different from `ValidateHooks`?
- The `WriteHooks` interface defines methods that are called after an insert, update, or delete operation has been written to the store. These methods can be used for indexing state in another database. The main difference between `WriteHooks` and `ValidateHooks` is that `WriteHooks` is called after the operation has been written to the store, while `ValidateHooks` is called before the operation is performed.
