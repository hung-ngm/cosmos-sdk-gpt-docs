The `ormtable` package contains code related to object-relational mapping (ORM) for the Cosmos SDK project. The `primaryKeyIndex` type is a struct that defines an `UniqueIndex` for the primary key. It contains a `PrimaryKeyCodec` field, which is used to encode and decode primary keys, a `fields` field, which is a list of field names, and an `indexers` field, which is a list of indexers. The `getBackend` function is a function that returns a `ReadBackend` and an error.

The `primaryKeyIndex` type implements several methods. The `List` method returns an iterator over all the objects in the index that have the given prefix key. The `ListRange` method returns an iterator over all the objects in the index that have keys in the given range. The `Has` method checks if an object with the given primary key exists in the index. The `Get` method retrieves an object with the given primary key from the index. The `DeleteBy` method deletes an object with the given primary key from the index. The `DeleteRange` method deletes all objects in the index that have keys in the given range.

The `primaryKeyIndex` type also has several helper methods. The `getWriteBackend` method returns a `Backend` that can be used for writing to the index. The `doDelete` method deletes an object with the given primary key from the index. The `doDeleteWithWriteBatch` method deletes an object with the given primary key from the index and updates the index's secondary indexes. The `getByKeyBytes` method retrieves an object with the given primary key from the index. The `readValueFromIndexKey` method reads a value from an index key. The `Fields` method returns a string representation of the field names.

Overall, the `primaryKeyIndex` type provides an interface for working with a primary key index in the Cosmos SDK ORM. It can be used to list, retrieve, and delete objects from the index, as well as to work with the index's secondary indexes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a struct called `primaryKeyIndex` which implements the `UniqueIndex` interface and provides methods for listing, getting, and deleting objects by primary key.

2. What other packages or modules does this code file depend on?
- This code file depends on several other packages and modules, including `ormerrors`, `fieldnames`, `ormlist`, `encodeutil`, `proto`, `protoreflect`, and `ormkv`.

3. What is the expected behavior of the `doDeleteWithWriteBatch` method?
- The `doDeleteWithWriteBatch` method is expected to delete an object from the index and clear its associated indexes, while also validating and executing any hooks associated with the backend. It returns an error if any of these operations fail.
