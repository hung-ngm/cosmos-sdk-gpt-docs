The `ormtable` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) layer for working with key-value stores. This specific file defines the interfaces and implementations for read-only and read-write backends.

The `ReadBackend` interface defines methods for reading data from the key-value store. It includes two methods: `CommitmentStoreReader()` and `IndexStoreReader()`. The `Backend` interface extends `ReadBackend` and adds methods for writing data to the key-value store. It includes methods such as `CommitmentStore()` and `IndexStore()` for accessing the stores, and `WithValidateHooks()` and `WithWriteHooks()` for adding hooks to ORM operations.

The `ReadBackendOptions` and `BackendOptions` structs define options for creating read-only and read-write backends, respectively. They include fields for the commitment store, index store, and hooks.

The `NewReadBackend()` and `NewBackend()` functions create new instances of read-only and read-write backends, respectively. They take in options structs and return a new backend object.

The `BackendResolver` type is a function that resolves a backend from the context or returns an error. The `WrapContextDefault()` function wraps a backend in a context for testing purposes.

Overall, this file provides the necessary interfaces and implementations for working with key-value stores in a read-only or read-write manner using the ORM layer provided by the `cosmos-sdk` project. Here is an example of how to create a new read-write backend:

```
options := BackendOptions{
    CommitmentStore: kv.NewStore(db, prefix),
    IndexStore:      kv.NewStore(db, indexPrefix),
    ValidateHooks:   myValidateHooks,
    WriteHooks:      myWriteHooks,
}
backend := NewBackend(options)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Backend` interface and its methods?
- The `Backend` interface defines the type used for read-write ORM operations and provides methods for accessing the merklized commitment store and index store, as well as hooks for validation and write operations.

2. What is the difference between `ReadBackend` and `Backend`?
- `ReadBackend` is used for read-only ORM operations and only provides methods for accessing the commitment store and index store readers, while `Backend` is used for read-write ORM operations and provides additional methods for accessing the commitment store and index store, as well as hooks for validation and write operations.

3. What is the purpose of the `BackendResolver` type and `WrapContextDefault` function?
- The `BackendResolver` type is a function that resolves a backend from the context or returns an error, and the `WrapContextDefault` function performs the default wrapping of a backend in a context. These are used to provide a way to access the backend from within the context of a request or operation.
