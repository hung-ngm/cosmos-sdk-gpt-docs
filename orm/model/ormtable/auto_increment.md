The `autoIncrementTable` struct is a Table implementation for tables with an auto-incrementing uint64 primary key. It provides methods for inserting, saving, updating, and retrieving the last inserted sequence. 

The `InsertReturningPKey` method inserts a new row into the table and returns the new primary key value. The `Save` method saves a message to the table, while the `Insert` method inserts a new row into the table. The `Update` method updates an existing row in the table. 

The `LastInsertedSequence` method retrieves the last inserted sequence number. 

The `save` method saves a message to the table with the specified mode. If the primary key is not set and the mode is `saveModeInsert`, it generates a new primary key and sets it in the message. If the primary key is already set and the mode is `saveModeInsert`, it returns an error. If the primary key is not set and the mode is `saveModeUpdate`, it returns an error. If the primary key is already set and the mode is `saveModeUpdate`, it updates the existing row in the table. 

The `curSeqValue` method retrieves the current sequence value from the store. The `nextSeqValue` method retrieves the current sequence value and increments it by one. The `setSeqValue` method sets the sequence value in the store. 

The `EncodeEntry` method encodes an entry into bytes. The `ValidateJSON` method validates a JSON message against the table schema. The `ImportJSON` method imports a JSON message into the table. The `decodeAutoIncJSON` method decodes a JSON message with an auto-incrementing primary key. The `ExportJSON` method exports the table to a JSON message. 

The `GetTable` method returns the table if the message is of the same type as the table. 

Overall, the `autoIncrementTable` struct provides a way to interact with tables that have an auto-incrementing primary key. It provides methods for inserting, saving, updating, and retrieving data from the table, as well as encoding and decoding JSON messages.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `autoIncrementTable` struct?
- The `autoIncrementTable` struct is a Table implementation for tables with an auto-incrementing uint64 primary key.

2. What is the role of the `save` method in the `autoIncrementTable` struct?
- The `save` method is responsible for saving a message to the backend, either by inserting or updating it, and generating a new primary key if necessary.

3. What is the purpose of the `ExportJSON` method in the `autoIncrementTable` struct?
- The `ExportJSON` method is used to export the contents of the table to JSON format, including the current sequence number.
