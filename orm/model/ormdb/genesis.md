The `ormdb` package contains code related to object-relational mapping (ORM) for the Cosmos SDK project. The `appModuleGenesisWrapper` struct is a wrapper around a `moduleDB` struct that provides methods for initializing, exporting, validating, and retrieving data from the database. 

The `DefaultGenesis` method writes the default JSON representation of each table to a `GenesisTarget` object. The method first retrieves the names of all tables in the database and sorts them alphabetically. It then iterates over each table, retrieves the corresponding `GenesisTarget` object, writes the default JSON representation of the table to the object, and closes the object. 

The `ValidateGenesis` method validates the JSON representation of each table in a `GenesisSource` object. The method first retrieves the names of all tables in the database and sorts them alphabetically. It then iterates over each table, retrieves the corresponding `GenesisSource` object, validates the JSON representation of the table, and closes the object. If any errors occur during validation, the method returns a `JSONValidationError` error that contains a string representation of all errors.

The `InitGenesis` method initializes the database with data from a `GenesisSource` object. The method first retrieves the names of all tables in the database and sorts them alphabetically. It then iterates over each table, retrieves the corresponding `GenesisSource` object, imports the JSON representation of the table into the database, and closes the object.

The `ExportGenesis` method exports the JSON representation of each table to a `GenesisTarget` object. The method first retrieves the names of all tables in the database and sorts them alphabetically. It then iterates over each table, retrieves the corresponding `GenesisTarget` object, exports the JSON representation of the table to the object, and closes the object.

Overall, the `appModuleGenesisWrapper` struct provides a convenient interface for initializing, exporting, validating, and retrieving data from the database. It is used in the larger Cosmos SDK project to manage the state of the blockchain. Below is an example of how the `DefaultGenesis` method can be used:

```
wrapper := appModuleGenesisWrapper{moduleDB: myModuleDB}
target := myGenesisTarget
err := wrapper.DefaultGenesis(target)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `appModuleGenesisWrapper` struct?
- The `appModuleGenesisWrapper` struct is a wrapper around a `moduleDB` that implements the `appmodule.GenesisModule` interface.

2. What is the purpose of the `DefaultGenesis` function?
- The `DefaultGenesis` function generates the default genesis state for the module by writing the default JSON representation of each table to the provided `appmodule.GenesisTarget`.

3. What is the purpose of the `ExportGenesis` function?
- The `ExportGenesis` function exports the current state of the module by writing the JSON representation of each table to the provided `appmodule.GenesisTarget`.
