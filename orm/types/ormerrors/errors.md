The `ormerrors` package contains error definitions and a function to check if a given error indicates that a record was not found. The purpose of this package is to provide a standardized set of error messages that can be used throughout the larger project to communicate specific issues related to object-relational mapping (ORM).

The `IsNotFound` function takes an error as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the error is of type `NotFound`. This function can be used to check if an error returned by an ORM operation is due to a record not being found. For example:

```
err := orm.Find(&myRecord)
if ormerrors.IsNotFound(err) {
    // handle not found error
} else if err != nil {
    // handle other error
}
```

The package also defines a set of error variables, each with a unique error code and message. These errors cover a range of issues related to ORM operations, such as missing primary keys, invalid field definitions, and duplicate keys. Each error is associated with a specific error code and message, which can be used to identify and handle specific errors in a standardized way throughout the project.

For example, the `PrimaryKeyConstraintViolation` error can be used to indicate that an object with the same primary key already exists in the database. This error can be returned by ORM operations that attempt to insert a new record with a primary key that already exists. By using a standardized error message, the project can ensure that all ORM-related errors are communicated in a consistent and understandable way.

Overall, the `ormerrors` package provides a standardized set of error messages and a function to check for not found errors. This helps to ensure that ORM-related errors are communicated in a consistent and understandable way throughout the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ormerrors` package?
- The `ormerrors` package contains error definitions related to object-relational mapping (ORM) operations.

2. What is the significance of the `codespace` variable?
- The `codespace` variable is a string that is used as a prefix for all error codes defined in this package.

3. What is the difference between `UniqueKeyViolation` and `PrimaryKeyConstraintViolation` errors?
- `UniqueKeyViolation` is used when a unique key constraint is violated, while `PrimaryKeyConstraintViolation` is used when an object with the same primary key already exists.
