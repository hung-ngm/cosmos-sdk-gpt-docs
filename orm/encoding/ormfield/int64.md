The `Int64Codec` struct is a codec used for encoding and decoding 64-bit integers as big-endian unsigned 64-bit integers. The purpose of this codec is to allow these values to be used for ordered iteration. The maximum value of int32 (9223372036854775807) + 1 is added before encoding to ensure that the values can be ordered correctly. 

The `Int64Codec` struct has several methods that allow it to be used in the larger project. The `Decode` method decodes a binary representation of a 64-bit integer and returns a `protoreflect.Value`. The `Encode` method encodes a `protoreflect.Value` as a binary representation of a 64-bit integer. The `Compare` method compares two `protoreflect.Value`s and returns an integer indicating their relative order. The `IsOrdered` method returns a boolean indicating whether the codec produces ordered values. The `FixedBufferSize` method returns the fixed buffer size of the codec, which is 8 bytes. The `ComputeBufferSize` method computes the buffer size required to encode a `protoreflect.Value`.

Here is an example of how the `Int64Codec` might be used in the larger project:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/codec"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/store/types"
)

// create a new codec
var cdc = codec.New()

// create a new store with the Int64Codec
store := types.NewStore(db, cdc, types.CodecRegistry{Int64Codec: int64Codec})
```

In this example, a new codec is created using the `New` method from the `codec` package. The `NewStore` method from the `types` package is then used to create a new store with the `Int64Codec`. This store can then be used to store and retrieve data using 64-bit integers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Int64Codec` struct and how does it encode 64-bit integers?
- The `Int64Codec` struct encodes 64-bit integers as big-endian unsigned 64-bit integers by adding the maximum value of int32 before encoding so that these values can be used for ordered iteration.

2. What is the significance of the `int64Max` constant and how is it used in the `Decode` and `Encode` methods?
- The `int64Max` constant is the maximum value of int32 and is used in the `Decode` and `Encode` methods to add or subtract it from the encoded value to ensure that it can be used for ordered iteration.

3. What is the purpose of the `compareInt` function and how is it used in the `Compare` method?
- The `compareInt` function compares two `protoreflect.Value` objects that contain 64-bit integers and returns an integer that indicates their relative order. It is used in the `Compare` method to compare two `protoreflect.Value` objects that contain 64-bit integers.
