The `ormfield` package contains two codecs for encoding and decoding uint64 values. The `FixedUint64Codec` encodes uint64 values as 8-byte big-endian integers, while the `CompactUint64Codec` encodes uint64 values using `EncodeCompactUint64`. The `FixedUint64Codec` is suitable for encoding uint64 values that are always 8 bytes long, while the `CompactUint64Codec` is suitable for encoding uint64 values in 2, 4, 6, or 9 bytes. 

The `FixedUint64Codec` implements the `Codec` interface, which requires it to implement the `FixedBufferSize()`, `ComputeBufferSize()`, `IsOrdered()`, `Compare()`, `Decode()`, and `Encode()` methods. The `FixedBufferSize()` method returns the fixed buffer size of 8 bytes, while the `ComputeBufferSize()` method returns the same fixed buffer size and a nil error. The `IsOrdered()` method returns true, indicating that the codec is suitable for ordered prefix scans. The `Compare()` method compares two uint64 values and returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the first value is less than, equal to, or greater than the second value. The `Decode()` method reads an 8-byte big-endian integer from a reader and returns a `protoreflect.Value` of uint64 type. The `Encode()` method writes an 8-byte big-endian integer to a writer.

The `CompactUint64Codec` also implements the `Codec` interface, but with different implementations of the methods. The `Decode()` method reads a compact-encoded uint64 value from a reader using the `DecodeCompactUint64()` function and returns a `protoreflect.Value` of uint64 type. The `Encode()` method encodes a uint64 value using the `EncodeCompactUint64()` function and writes the resulting bytes to a writer. The `Compare()`, `IsOrdered()`, `FixedBufferSize()`, and `ComputeBufferSize()` methods are implemented similarly to the `FixedUint64Codec`.

The `EncodeCompactUint64()` function encodes uint64 values in 2, 4, 6, or 9 bytes, depending on the value's size. The first two bits of the first byte indicate the length of the buffer, with 00 for 2 bytes, 01 for 4 bytes, 10 for 6 bytes, and 11 for 9 bytes. The remaining bits are encoded with big-endian ordering. Values less than 2^14 fill fit in 2 bytes, values less than 2^30 will fit in 4 bytes, and values less than 2^46 will fit in 6 bytes.

The `DecodeCompactUint64()` function decodes compact-encoded uint64 values from a reader. It reads the first byte to determine the length of the buffer and then reads the remaining bytes using big-endian ordering. It returns the decoded uint64 value and an error if any.

These codecs are used in the larger project to encode and decode uint64 values in a compact and efficient manner. They are used in various parts of the project that require encoding and decoding of uint64 values, such as in the storage layer. For example, the `Encode()` and `Decode()` methods of these codecs may be used to encode and decode uint64 values stored in a key-value store.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ormfield` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The code in this file defines two codecs, `FixedUint64Codec` and `CompactUint64Codec`, for encoding and decoding uint64 values in a specific format.

2. What is the difference between `FixedUint64Codec` and `CompactUint64Codec`?
- `FixedUint64Codec` encodes uint64 values as 8-byte big-endian integers, while `CompactUint64Codec` encodes uint64 values using a variable-length encoding scheme that uses 2, 4, 6, or 9 bytes depending on the value being encoded.

3. What is the purpose of the `EncodeCompactUint64` and `DecodeCompactUint64` functions?
- `EncodeCompactUint64` encodes uint64 values using a variable-length encoding scheme that is suitable for ordered prefix scans, while `DecodeCompactUint64` decodes uint64 values that have been encoded using this scheme.
