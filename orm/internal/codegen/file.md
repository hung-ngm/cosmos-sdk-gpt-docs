The `codegen` package contains code that generates Go code for the Cosmos SDK ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) module. The ORM module is used to map data between a relational database and an object-oriented programming language. The generated code is used to create a store interface and struct for each table in the database schema. 

The `fileGen` struct is the main struct in this package, and it contains methods for generating the store interface, struct, and methods. The `gen()` method is the entry point for generating the code. It generates the store interface and struct for each table in the schema, and then generates the methods for each store. 

The `genStoreInterface()` method generates the store interface for each table in the schema. The interface contains a method for each table, which returns the table interface. The `genStoreStruct()` method generates the store struct, which contains a field for each table interface. 

The `genStoreMethods()` method generates the methods for each table interface. It generates a getter method for each table, which returns the table interface. The `genStoreConstructor()` method generates the constructor for the store struct. It creates a new instance of each table interface and adds it to the store struct. 

The `fieldsToCamelCase()` and `fieldsToSnakeCase()` functions are utility functions that convert field names from snake case to camel case and vice versa. 

Overall, this code is used to generate the ORM module for the Cosmos SDK. It generates the store interface and struct for each table in the database schema, and provides methods for accessing and manipulating the data in the tables.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code generates a store interface and struct for tables and singletons defined in a protobuf file, and provides methods for accessing them.

2. What external packages are being imported and what are they used for?
- The code imports `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/generator`, `github.com/iancoleman/strcase`, and `google.golang.org/protobuf/compiler/protogen` for generating code and working with protobuf files, and `cosmossdk.io/api/cosmos/orm/v1` for accessing ORM-related extensions in the protobuf file.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `New` function, and what does it do?
- The `New` function takes a `Schema` object and returns a store interface and an error. It constructs a new store struct with table and singleton objects created from the `Schema`, and returns it as the store interface.
