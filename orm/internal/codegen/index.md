The `codegen` package contains code generation utilities for the Cosmos SDK. The `tableGen` struct is defined in this file, which is used to generate code for a table in the database. The `genIndexKeys` function generates the primary key and all secondary indexes for the table. The `genIterator` function generates an iterator for the table. The `genIndexMethods` function generates methods for the index key, such as `id()`, `values()`, and `indexKeyInterfaceName()`. The `genIndexInterfaceGuard` function generates a guard for the index key interface. The `indexKeyInterfaceName` function generates the name of the index key interface. The `genIndexKey` function generates the index key struct. The `indexKeyParts` function generates the index key parts. The `indexKeyName` function generates the index key name. The `indexStructName` function generates the index struct name. The `genIndex` function generates the index struct and its methods.

This code is used to generate code for a table in the Cosmos SDK database. The generated code includes the primary key and all secondary indexes for the table, as well as an iterator for the table. The generated code also includes methods for the index key, such as `id()`, `values()`, and `indexKeyInterfaceName()`. The generated code is used to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the table.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `genIndexKeys` function?
- The `genIndexKeys` function generates code for primary and secondary indexes for a table.

2. What is the purpose of the `genIterator` function?
- The `genIterator` function generates code for an iterator that can be used to iterate over the values in a table.

3. What is the purpose of the `genWithMethods` function?
- The `genWithMethods` function generates code for a method that sets the values of a specific index key in an index struct.
