The code defines the implementation of the ABCIListener interface for the cosmos-sdk project. The ABCIListener interface is used to listen to and respond to various ABCI (Application BlockChain Interface) messages that are sent between the Tendermint consensus engine and the application running on top of it. The GRPCClient struct is an implementation of the ABCIListener interface that communicates over RPC. 

The code defines four methods: ListenBeginBlock, ListenEndBlock, ListenDeliverTx, and ListenCommit. Each method listens to a specific ABCI message and responds accordingly. For example, ListenBeginBlock listens to the BeginBlock message, which is sent at the beginning of each block, and retrieves a types.Context from a context.Context instance. It then sends a request to the GRPC server to listen to the BeginBlock message and waits for a response. If an error occurs and the node is configured to stop on listening errors, it will terminate immediately and exit with a non-zero code. 

The GRPCServer struct is the gRPC server that the GRPCClient talks to. It contains the real implementation of the ABCIListener interface. The ListenBeginBlock, ListenEndBlock, ListenDeliverTx, and ListenCommit methods of the GRPCServer struct call the corresponding methods of the ABCIListener interface implementation and return a response. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the cosmos-sdk project as it defines the implementation of the ABCIListener interface, which is used to communicate between the Tendermint consensus engine and the application running on top of it. It allows the application to listen to and respond to various ABCI messages, which is essential for the proper functioning of the blockchain. 

Example usage:

```
// create a new GRPCClient
client := &GRPCClient{client: ABCIListenerServiceClient}

// listen to the BeginBlock message
req := abci.RequestBeginBlock{}
res := abci.ResponseBeginBlock{}
err := client.ListenBeginBlock(context.Background(), req, res)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error listening to BeginBlock message:", err)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GRPCClient` and `GRPCServer` structs?
- The `GRPCClient` struct is an implementation of the `ABCIListener` interface that communicates over RPC, while the `GRPCServer` struct is the gRPC server that the `GRPCClient` talks to.

2. What is the `ListenCommit` function responsible for?
- The `ListenCommit` function listens to commit responses and state changes for the current block, retrieves a `types.Context` from a `context.Context` instance, and panics if a `types.Context` was not properly attached.

3. What happens when an error occurs during listening hooks and the node is configured to stop on listening errors?
- When an error occurs during listening hooks and the node is configured to stop on listening errors, the `cleanupAndExit()` function is called, which cleans up the clients and exits the program with a non-zero code.
