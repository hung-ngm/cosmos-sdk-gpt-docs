The `types` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains various types and functions used throughout the project. This particular file defines methods for the `StoreInfo` and `CommitInfo` types.

The `GetHash()` method for `StoreInfo` returns the hash of the `CommitID` associated with the store. This method is used in the `toMap()` method for `CommitInfo` to create a map of store names to their respective hashes. The `Hash()` method for `CommitInfo` then uses this map to compute the merkle root hash of all the stores sorted by name. Finally, the `CommitID()` method for `CommitInfo` returns a `CommitID` struct with the version and computed hash.

These methods are used in the larger project to manage and verify the state of the application. Specifically, the `CommitInfo` struct is used to represent the state of the application at a particular version, and the `CommitID` struct is used to identify a particular version of the application. The merkle root hash computed by the `Hash()` method is used to verify the integrity of the application state, and the `ProofOp()` method is used to generate a proof of the application state for use in consensus algorithms.

Here is an example of how these methods might be used in the larger project:

```
// create a new CommitInfo struct
ci := CommitInfo{
    Version: 1,
    StoreInfos: []StoreInfo{
        {Name: "store1", CommitId: CommitID{Version: 1, Hash: []byte("hash1")}},
        {Name: "store2", CommitId: CommitID{Version: 1, Hash: []byte("hash2")}},
    },
}

// compute the merkle root hash of the stores
rootHash := ci.Hash()

// generate a proof of the state of "store1"
proofOp := ci.ProofOp("store1")

// create a new CommitID struct for this version
commitID := ci.CommitID()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetHash` function in the `StoreInfo` struct?
- The `GetHash` function returns the `Hash` value from the `CommitID` of the `StoreInfo` struct, which is used in `CommitInfo.Hash()`.

2. What does the `Hash` function in the `CommitInfo` struct return?
- The `Hash` function returns the simple merkle root hash of the stores sorted by name, using the `ProofsFromMap` function from the `maps` package.

3. What is the purpose of the `ProofOp` function in the `CommitInfo` struct?
- The `ProofOp` function returns a `ProofOp` object for a given store name, using the `ProofOpFromMap` function from the `cmtprotocrypto` package.
