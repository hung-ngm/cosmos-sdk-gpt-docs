The `metrics` package provides a set of metrics for the `store` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project. The `StoreMetrics` interface defines a single method `MeasureSince` that is used to measure the time elapsed since a given point in time. The `Metrics` struct implements the `StoreMetrics` interface and provides a wrapper functionality for emitting a time measure metric with global labels (if any). The `Labels` field in the `Metrics` struct is an array of `metrics.Label` that contains the labels set by the node operator. The `NewMetrics` function returns a new instance of the `Metrics` struct with the labels set by the node operator. If there are no global labels, an empty `Metrics` struct is returned.

The `NoOpMetrics` struct is a no-op implementation of the `StoreMetrics` interface. It is used to avoid `time.Now()` calls. The `NewNoOpMetrics` function returns a new instance of the `NoOpMetrics` struct.

The `MeasureSince` method in the `Metrics` struct calls the `MeasureSinceWithLabels` function in the `github.com/armon/go-metrics` package with the given `keys`, the start time, and the global labels (if any). The `MeasureSinceWithLabels` function measures the time elapsed since the start time and emits a time measure metric with the given `keys` and global labels (if any).

This package is used to measure the performance of the `store` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project. The `MeasureSince` method can be used to measure the time elapsed since a given point in time and emit a time measure metric with global labels (if any). The `Metrics` struct can be used to set the global labels for the time measure metric. The `NoOpMetrics` struct can be used to avoid `time.Now()` calls in cases where performance measurement is not required.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `metrics` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `metrics` package defines a set of metrics for the store package.

2. What is the difference between `Metrics` and `NoOpMetrics`?
- `Metrics` is a wrapper for the store package that provides functionality for emitting a time measure metric with global labels, while `NoOpMetrics` is a no-op implementation of the `StoreMetrics` interface that avoids `time.Now()` calls.

3. What is the purpose of the `MeasureSince` method?
- The `MeasureSince` method provides a wrapper functionality for emitting a time measure metric with global labels (if any).
