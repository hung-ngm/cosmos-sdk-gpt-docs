The code in this file provides two functions related to proof generation and verification in the cosmos-sdk project. 

The first function, `RequireProof`, takes a subpath string as input and returns a boolean indicating whether a proof is required for that subpath. Currently, the function only returns true if the subpath is "/key". This convention may change in the future if there are changes to proof building in the `iavlstore.go` file. 

The second function, `DefaultProofRuntime`, returns a `merkle.ProofRuntime` object that is used to register proof operations. This function is intended to be managed by the `rootMultiStore` and may be used to register additional proof operations in the future. Currently, the function registers two proof operation decoders: `ProofOpIAVLCommitment` and `ProofOpSimpleMerkleCommitment`, both of which use the `CommitmentOpDecoder` function from the `storetypes` package. 

Overall, these functions provide a way to manage and generate proofs for specific subpaths in the cosmos-sdk project. For example, the `RequireProof` function may be used to determine whether a proof is required for a particular query, while the `DefaultProofRuntime` function may be used to register additional proof operations as needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RequireProof` function?
- The `RequireProof` function determines whether a proof is required for a given subpath, and currently only returns true if the subpath is "/key".

2. What is the `DefaultProofRuntime` function used for?
- The `DefaultProofRuntime` function creates a new `merkle.ProofRuntime` and registers two proof operation decoders for `storetypes.ProofOpIAVLCommitment` and `storetypes.ProofOpSimpleMerkleCommitment`.

3. What is the significance of the `XXX` comments in the code?
- The `XXX` comments indicate that there is something that needs to be improved or managed, such as creating a better convention or managing proof operations through the `rootMultiStore`.
