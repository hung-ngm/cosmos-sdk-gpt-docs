The `snapshots` package contains code for reading and writing snapshot data. Snapshots are a way to store a copy of the state of a blockchain at a particular point in time, which can be used to speed up syncing new nodes to the network. 

The `ChunkWriter` type reads an input stream and writes it to a sequence of `io.ReadCloser` objects via a channel. The input stream is split into fixed-size chunks, and each chunk is written to a new `io.ReadCloser` object. The `ChunkWriter` can be used to write snapshot data to disk or send it over a network connection. 

The `ChunkReader` type reads chunks from a channel of `io.ReadCloser` objects and outputs them as an `io.Reader`. The `ChunkReader` can be used to read snapshot data from disk or receive it over a network connection. 

The `DrainChunks` function is used to close all remaining chunks in a chunk channel. 

The `ValidRestoreHeight` function checks whether a given height is valid for snapshot restore. It returns an error if the snapshot format is unknown, the height is 0, or the height exceeds the maximum value of a signed 64-bit integer. 

Overall, the `snapshots` package provides functionality for reading and writing snapshot data, which is an important part of the Cosmos SDK's blockchain syncing process. Developers can use the `ChunkWriter` and `ChunkReader` types to write and read snapshot data, respectively, and the `ValidRestoreHeight` function to validate snapshot restore heights.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ChunkWriter` and `ChunkReader` types?
- The `ChunkWriter` type reads an input stream, splits it into fixed-size chunks, and writes them to a sequence of `io.ReadClosers` via a channel. The `ChunkReader` type reads chunks from a channel of `io.ReadClosers` and outputs them as an `io.Reader`.

2. What is the purpose of the `ValidRestoreHeight` function?
- The `ValidRestoreHeight` function checks if a given height is valid for snapshot restore or not. It returns an error if the format is unknown, the height is 0, or the height exceeds the maximum value of `math.MaxInt64`.

3. What is the purpose of the `DrainChunks` function?
- The `DrainChunks` function drains and closes all remaining chunks from a chunk channel.
