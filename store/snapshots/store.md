The `snapshots` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code for managing snapshot data. Snapshots are a way to store a point-in-time copy of the state of a blockchain, which can be used to speed up syncing and recovery. The `Store` struct is the main type in this package, representing a snapshot store that contains both metadata and binary chunks.

The `NewStore` function creates a new snapshot store, given a database and a directory to store the snapshots. The `Delete` function deletes a snapshot at a given height and format. The `Get` function fetches snapshot metadata from the database, given a height and format. The `GetLatest` function fetches the latest snapshot from the database, if any. The `List` function lists all snapshots in reverse order (newest first). The `Load` function loads a snapshot (both metadata and binary chunks) and returns a channel of chunk readers. The `LoadChunk` function loads a single chunk from disk. The `Prune` function removes old snapshots, retaining a given number of most recent heights. Finally, the `Save` function saves a snapshot to disk, given a height, format, and a channel of chunk readers.

The `saveChunk` function saves a given chunk to disk, updates the snapshot metadata with the chunk hash, and updates the overall snapshot hash with the chunk content. The `saveSnapshot` function saves snapshot metadata to the database. The `pathHeight`, `pathSnapshot`, and `pathChunk` functions generate paths for snapshot directories and files. The `decodeKey` and `encodeKey` functions encode and decode snapshot keys, which are used as database keys.

Overall, this package provides functionality for managing snapshot data, including saving, loading, and deleting snapshots, as well as listing and pruning snapshots. It is used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to provide snapshot functionality for blockchain nodes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `snapshots` package?
- The `snapshots` package is a snapshot store that contains snapshot metadata and binary chunks.

2. What is the role of the `saving` map in the `Store` struct?
- The `saving` map in the `Store` struct keeps track of the heights that are currently being saved.

3. What is the purpose of the `encodeKey` and `decodeKey` functions?
- The `encodeKey` function encodes a snapshot key, while the `decodeKey` function decodes a snapshot key. These functions are used to interact with the snapshot database.
