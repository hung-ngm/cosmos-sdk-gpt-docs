The `types` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains various data structures and utility functions used throughout the project. One such utility function is `WriteExtensionPayload`, which is used to write an extension payload for the current extension snapshotter.

The function takes in two arguments: a `protoio.Writer` and a byte slice `payload`. The `protoio.Writer` is a protocol buffer writer that is used to serialize data into a binary format. The `payload` argument is the actual data that needs to be serialized.

The function creates a new `SnapshotItem` message and sets its `Item` field to an `ExtensionPayload` message. The `ExtensionPayload` message contains a single field `Payload`, which is set to the `payload` argument passed to the function. The `SnapshotItem` message is then written to the `protoio.Writer` using the `WriteMsg` method.

This function is likely used in the larger project to serialize extension payloads for snapshotting. Snapshotting is the process of creating a snapshot of the current state of the blockchain, which can be used to quickly restore the state in case of a failure or to speed up syncing with other nodes. Extensions are additional data that can be included in the snapshot, such as metadata or custom state information. This function allows for easy serialization of extension payloads into the binary format used for snapshots.

Example usage:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
    "github.com/cosmos/gogoproto/io"
)

func main() {
    payload := []byte("example payload")
    writer := io.NewDelimitedWriter(someWriter)
    err := types.WriteExtensionPayload(writer, payload)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `protoio` package being imported?
   - The `protoio` package is being imported to provide a `Writer` interface for protocol buffer serialization.

2. What is the `SnapshotItem` struct and where is it defined?
   - The `SnapshotItem` struct is being used to write an extension payload and is likely defined in another file within the `cosmos-sdk` project.

3. What is the expected format of the `payload` parameter being passed to `WriteExtensionPayload`?
   - The `payload` parameter is expected to be a byte slice containing the extension payload data to be written.
