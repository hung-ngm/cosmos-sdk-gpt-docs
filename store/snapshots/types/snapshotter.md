This file defines two interfaces: Snapshotter and ExtensionSnapshotter. These interfaces are used in the larger cosmos-sdk project to manage state snapshots of the blockchain. 

The Snapshotter interface defines methods for creating and restoring snapshots. The Snapshot method writes snapshot items into a protobuf writer, while the Restore method restores a state snapshot from a protobuf message stream. The PruneSnapshotHeight method prunes the given height according to the prune strategy, and the SetSnapshotInterval method sets the interval at which snapshots are taken. 

The ExtensionSnapshotter interface is an extension of the Snapshotter interface. It defines methods for managing extension snapshots, which are appended to the snapshot stream. The SnapshotExtension method writes extension payloads into the underlying protobuf stream, while the RestoreExtension method restores an extension state snapshot. The SnapshotName method returns the name of the snapshotter, which should be unique in the manager. The SnapshotFormat method returns the default format the extension snapshotter uses to encode the payloads when taking a snapshot, and the SupportedFormats method returns a list of formats it can restore from.

These interfaces are used throughout the cosmos-sdk project to manage state snapshots of the blockchain. For example, the Snapshotter interface is implemented by the SnapshotStore, which is responsible for creating and restoring snapshots of the blockchain state. The ExtensionSnapshotter interface is implemented by various modules in the cosmos-sdk project, such as the IBC module, which uses it to manage snapshots of inter-blockchain communication state. 

Here is an example of how the Snapshotter interface might be used in the cosmos-sdk project:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
)

func main() {
    // create a new snapshot store
    snapshotStore := types.NewSnapshotStore()

    // take a snapshot of the current blockchain state
    err := snapshotStore.Snapshot(100, protoWriter)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }

    // restore a previous snapshot of the blockchain state
    snapshotItem, err := snapshotStore.Restore(50, format, protoReader)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Snapshotter` interface?
- The `Snapshotter` interface is used to create and restore snapshots consisting of streamed binary chunks, and it defines methods for writing and pruning snapshots.

2. What is the difference between `ExtensionPayloadReader` and `ExtensionPayloadWriter`?
- `ExtensionPayloadReader` is a function that reads extension payloads and returns an error when it reaches the end of the stream or extension boundaries, while `ExtensionPayloadWriter` is a function that writes extension payloads to an underlying stream.

3. What is the purpose of the `ExtensionSnapshotter` interface?
- The `ExtensionSnapshotter` interface is an extension of the `Snapshotter` interface that is appended to the snapshot stream, and it defines methods for writing and restoring extension payloads, as well as returning information about the snapshotter's name and supported formats.
