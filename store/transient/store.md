The `transient` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains a `Store` struct that is a wrapper for a `MemDB` with a `Committer` implementation. The purpose of this code is to provide a temporary, in-memory key-value store that can be used for transient data storage during the execution of a transaction. 

The `Store` struct implements the `types.Committer` and `types.KVStore` interfaces, which means it can be used like any other key-value store in the `cosmos-sdk` project. The `NewStore()` function constructs a new `MemDB` adapter and returns a new instance of the `Store` struct. 

The `Commit()` method is used to clean up the `Store` after a transaction has been committed. It creates a new `MemDB` adapter and assigns it to the `Store` struct, effectively clearing out any data that was stored in the previous `MemDB`. 

The `SetPruning()` method is a no-op, as pruning options cannot be directly set on this store. They must be set on the root commit multi-store. The `GetPruning()` method returns a new instance of `PruningOptions` with the value `PruningUndefined`, indicating that pruning options have not been set for this store. 

The `LastCommitID()` method returns an empty `CommitID`, as this store does not support commit IDs. The `WorkingHash()` method returns an empty byte slice, as this store does not support working hashes. 

The `GetStoreType()` method returns `StoreTypeTransient`, indicating that this store is a transient key-value store. 

Overall, the `Store` struct in the `transient` package provides a simple, in-memory key-value store that can be used for temporary data storage during the execution of a transaction in the `cosmos-sdk` project. It is useful for storing data that does not need to persist beyond the lifetime of a single transaction. 

Example usage:

```
store := transient.NewStore()
store.Set([]byte("key"), []byte("value"))
value, _ := store.Get([]byte("key"))
fmt.Println(string(value)) // Output: "value"
store.Commit()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `transient` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `transient` package provides a wrapper for a MemDB with Committer implementation.

2. What is the difference between `SetPruning` and `GetPruning` methods in the `Store` struct?
- `SetPruning` is a no-op method that does not set pruning options directly on the store, while `GetPruning` returns the pruning options set on the root commit multi-store.

3. What is the significance of the `types.Committer` and `types.KVStore` interfaces being implemented by the `Store` struct?
- The `types.Committer` and `types.KVStore` interfaces are implemented by the `Store` struct to provide commit and key-value store functionality, respectively.
