This code defines an interface called `Tree` that both mutable and immutable IAVL (interleaved AVL) trees must implement. The interface includes methods for querying, setting, and removing key-value pairs, as well as saving and deleting versions of the tree. The `Tree` interface also includes methods for getting the current version of the tree, getting the hash of the tree, and iterating over key-value pairs.

The `immutableTree` struct is a simple wrapper around a reference to an `iavl.ImmutableTree` that implements the `Tree` interface. It should only be used for querying and iteration, specifically at previous heights. The `immutableTree` struct overrides the `Set`, `Remove`, `SaveVersion`, `DeleteVersion`, `DeleteVersions`, `SetInitialVersion`, `AvailableVersions`, `LoadVersionForOverwriting`, `LazyLoadVersionForOverwriting`, and `WorkingHash` methods to panic when called, since these methods are not applicable to an immutable tree.

The `iavl` package is part of the larger `cosmos-sdk` project, which is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang. The `iavl` package provides an implementation of an IAVL tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains a balance factor for each node. The `Tree` interface and `immutableTree` struct are used throughout the `cosmos-sdk` project to provide a consistent interface for working with IAVL trees, whether they are mutable or immutable. Developers can use the `Tree` interface to interact with IAVL trees in a generic way, without worrying about the specific implementation details of the tree. For example, the `Tree` interface is used in the `store` package of the `cosmos-sdk` project to provide a key-value store that can be backed by an IAVL tree. Developers can use the `store` package to persist data in a blockchain application, and the `Tree` interface allows them to interact with the underlying IAVL tree in a consistent way. 

Example usage:

```
import (
    "cosmossdk.io/store"
    "cosmossdk.io/store/iavl"
)

// create a new mutable IAVL tree
tree := iavl.NewMutableTree(db, cacheSize)

// create a new immutable tree wrapper
immutable := &immutableTree{tree.ImmutableTree}

// use the immutable tree to get a value at a specific version
value, err := immutable.GetVersioned(key, version)

// use the mutable tree to set a value
tree.Set(key, value)

// use the store package to create a key-value store backed by an IAVL tree
store := store.NewCommitMultiStore(db)
store.MountStoreWithDB(key, store.StoreTypeIAVL, db)
store.LoadLatestVersion()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Tree` interface?
- The `Tree` interface defines the methods that both mutable and immutable IAVL trees must implement, including methods for querying, setting, and removing key-value pairs, as well as methods for versioning and iterating over the tree.

2. What is the difference between a mutable and immutable IAVL tree?
- A mutable IAVL tree can be modified by adding, updating, or deleting key-value pairs, while an immutable IAVL tree cannot be modified once it has been created. Instead, a new immutable tree must be created for each version of the tree.

3. Why does the `immutableTree` struct implement the `Tree` interface if it cannot modify the tree?
- The `immutableTree` struct is a simple wrapper around a reference to an `iavl.ImmutableTree` that implements the `Tree` interface for querying and iteration purposes. While it cannot modify the tree, it can still provide access to its key-value pairs and version history.
