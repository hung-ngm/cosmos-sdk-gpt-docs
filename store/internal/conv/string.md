The `conv` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains two functions, `UnsafeStrToBytes` and `UnsafeBytesToStr`, that use the `unsafe` package to perform low-level memory operations. 

The `UnsafeStrToBytes` function takes a string as input and returns a byte array. It does this by first creating an empty byte array `buf`, then using the `reflect` package to obtain pointers to the string header and slice header of `buf`. It then sets the `Data`, `Cap`, and `Len` fields of the slice header to the corresponding fields of the string header, effectively converting the string into a byte array. However, the function warns that the returned byte array must not be altered after the function is called, as doing so could cause a segmentation fault.

The `UnsafeBytesToStr` function takes a byte array as input and returns a string. It does this by using the `unsafe` package to cast the byte array pointer to a string pointer, effectively converting the byte array into a string. This function is meant to be used in a specific pattern to delete keys from a map, and is not intended for general use.

Overall, these functions provide low-level memory operations that can be used in specific cases where performance is critical. However, due to the use of the `unsafe` package, they should be used with caution and only when necessary. 

Example usage of `UnsafeStrToBytes`:
```
s := "hello world"
b := UnsafeStrToBytes(s)
fmt.Println(b) // output: [104 101 108 108 111 32 119 111 114 108 100]
```

Example usage of `UnsafeBytesToStr`:
```
b := []byte{104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100}
s := UnsafeBytesToStr(b)
fmt.Println(s) // output: "hello world"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UnsafeStrToBytes` function?
   - The purpose of the `UnsafeStrToBytes` function is to use unsafe to convert a string into a byte array. The returned bytes must not be altered after this function is called as it will cause a segmentation fault.

2. What is the purpose of the `UnsafeBytesToStr` function?
   - The purpose of the `UnsafeBytesToStr` function is to make a zero allocation conversion from `[]byte` to `string` to speed up operations. It is not meant to be used generally, but for a specific pattern to delete keys from a map.

3. Why is the use of `unsafe` package necessary in these functions?
   - The use of the `unsafe` package is necessary in these functions because they perform low-level memory operations that are not safe in Go's type system. By using `unsafe`, these functions can bypass the type system and access memory directly, which can improve performance in certain cases.
