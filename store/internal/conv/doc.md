The `conv` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides internal functions for conversions and data manipulation. This package is used to convert data from one format to another, such as converting a string to a byte array or vice versa. It also provides functions for manipulating data, such as reversing a byte array or converting a byte array to a hexadecimal string.

One of the key functions in this package is `Atoi`, which converts a string to an integer. This function takes a string as input and returns an integer. Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
import "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/conv"

func main() {
    str := "123"
    num := conv.Atoi(str)
    fmt.Println(num)
}
```

This code will output `123`, which is the integer value of the string `"123"`. 

Another important function in this package is `HexToBytes`, which converts a hexadecimal string to a byte array. This function takes a string as input and returns a byte array. Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
import "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/conv"

func main() {
    hexStr := "48656c6c6f20576f726c64"
    bytes := conv.HexToBytes(hexStr)
    fmt.Println(bytes)
}
```

This code will output `[72 101 108 108 111 32 87 111 114 108 100]`, which is the byte array representation of the hexadecimal string `"48656c6c6f20576f726c64"`, which translates to the ASCII string "Hello World".

Overall, the `conv` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides useful functions for converting and manipulating data. These functions can be used throughout the larger project to handle data in various formats and perform necessary conversions.
