The `proofs` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides functions for creating membership and non-membership proofs for a given key in a map. The package imports the `ics23` and `cosmossdk.io/store/internal/maps` packages.

The `CreateMembershipProof` function takes a map of strings to byte slices and a key as input. It returns a `CommitmentProof` and an error. The function first checks if the key is empty and returns an error if it is. It then calls the `createExistenceProof` function to create an `ExistenceProof` for the key. If the key does not exist in the map, the `createExistenceProof` function returns an error. The `ExistenceProof` is then used to create a `CommitmentProof` with the `Exist` field set to the `ExistenceProof`.

The `CreateNonMembershipProof` function takes a map of strings to byte slices and a key as input. It returns a `CommitmentProof` and an error. The function first checks if the key is empty and returns an error if it is. It then checks if the key exists in the map and returns an error if it does. The function then calls the `SortedKeys` function to get a sorted list of keys in the map. It uses the `sort.SearchStrings` function to find the index of the key in the sorted list of keys. It then creates a `NonExistenceProof` with the key and includes the `ExistenceProof` for the key to the left of the key in the sorted list of keys, if it exists, and the `ExistenceProof` for the key to the right of the key in the sorted list of keys, if it exists. The `NonExistenceProof` is then used to create a `CommitmentProof` with the `Nonexist` field set to the `NonExistenceProof`.

The `createExistenceProof` function takes a map of strings to byte slices and a key as input. It returns an `ExistenceProof` and an error. The function first checks if any key in the map is empty and returns an error if it is. It then checks if the key exists in the map and returns an error if it does not. The function then calls the `ProofsFromMap` function from the `sdkmaps` package to get the proofs for all keys in the map. It retrieves the `ExistenceProof` for the given key from the map of proofs and returns it along with the key and value.

These functions can be used to create proofs for keys in a map that can be used to verify the inclusion or exclusion of the key in the map. This can be useful in various applications such as blockchain and distributed ledger systems.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides functions to create membership and non-membership proofs for a given key in a map.

2. What external packages does this code use?
- This code uses the `github.com/confio/ics23/go` package for commitment proofs and `cosmossdk.io/store/internal/maps` package for creating proofs from a map.

3. What errors can be returned by the functions in this code?
- The functions in this code can return errors such as `ErrEmptyKey`, `ErrEmptyKeyInData`, `cannot create non-membership proof if key is in map`, `cannot make existence proof if key is not in map`, and `returned no proof for key`.
