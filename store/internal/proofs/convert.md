The `proofs` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains functions for converting cryptographic proofs between different formats. This file contains two functions, `ConvertExistenceProof` and `convertInnerOps`, which are used to convert a proof from the `cmtprotocrypto` format to the `ics23` format.

The `ConvertExistenceProof` function takes a `cmtprotocrypto.Proof` object, along with a key and value, and returns an `ics23.ExistenceProof` object. This function is used to convert a proof that demonstrates the existence of a key-value pair in a Merkle tree. The `convertInnerOps` function is a helper function that is used to convert the inner nodes of the proof.

The `ConvertExistenceProof` function first calls the `convertInnerOps` function to convert the inner nodes of the proof. It then creates a new `ics23.ExistenceProof` object, sets the key, value, and leaf hash, and adds the converted inner nodes to the proof. Finally, it returns the resulting `ics23.ExistenceProof` object.

The `convertInnerOps` function takes a `cmtprotocrypto.Proof` object and returns a slice of `ics23.InnerOp` objects. This function is used to convert the inner nodes of the proof. It first calls the `buildPath` function to generate a list of steps from the leaf to the root of the Merkle tree. It then iterates over the aunts (sibling nodes of the nodes on the path from the leaf to the root) in the proof and combines them with the corresponding step from the path to create an `ics23.InnerOp` object. Finally, it returns a slice of the resulting `ics23.InnerOp` objects.

The `buildPath` function takes an index and total number of nodes in a Merkle tree and returns a list of steps from the leaf to the root of the tree. It first calculates the split point of the tree using the `getSplitPoint` function. It then determines whether the index is on the left or right side of the split point and recursively calls itself with the appropriate sub-tree until it reaches the root. Finally, it returns the resulting list of steps.

Overall, these functions are used to convert cryptographic proofs between different formats in the `cosmos-sdk` project. The `ConvertExistenceProof` function is used to convert a proof that demonstrates the existence of a key-value pair in a Merkle tree, while the `convertInnerOps` function is used to convert the inner nodes of the proof. The `buildPath` and `getSplitPoint` functions are helper functions used by `convertInnerOps` to generate the list of steps from the leaf to the root of the Merkle tree.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ConvertExistenceProof` function?
- The `ConvertExistenceProof` function converts a given proof into a valid existence proof, with a focus on demoing compatibility.

2. What is the `convertLeafOp` function doing?
- The `convertLeafOp` function returns a `LeafOp` struct with specific values for `Hash`, `PrehashKey`, `PrehashValue`, `Length`, and `Prefix`.

3. What is the purpose of the `buildPath` function?
- The `buildPath` function returns a list of steps from leaf to root, where each step indicates whether the index is on the left or right side.
