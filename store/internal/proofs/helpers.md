The `proofs` package contains functions for generating range proofs for a random element in a Merkle tree. The `SimpleResult` struct contains the key, value, Merkle proof, and root hash needed to build a `confio/proof`. 

The `GenerateRangeProof` function takes in a size and a `Where` parameter that selects a location for the key (left, right, or middle). It builds a map of random key-value pairs using the `BuildMap` function, generates a Merkle tree using `sdkmaps.ProofsFromMap`, selects a random key using `GetKey`, and returns a `SimpleResult` containing the key, value, proof, and root hash. 

The `SortedKeys` function takes in a map of key-value pairs and returns a sorted list of keys. The `CalcRoot` function takes in a map of key-value pairs and returns the root hash of the corresponding Merkle tree. 

The `GetKey` function takes in a list of keys and a `Where` parameter and returns a key located on the left, right, or middle of the list. The `GetNonKey` function takes in a list of keys and a `Where` parameter and returns a key that is missing from the list, located on the left, right, or next to an existing key. 

The `toValue` function takes in a key and returns a value for that key. The `BuildMap` function takes in a size and generates a map of random key-value pairs, returning the map and a sorted list of keys. 

Overall, this package provides functionality for generating range proofs for a random element in a Merkle tree, as well as helper functions for working with maps and keys. These functions may be used in the larger project to provide cryptographic proofs for various operations.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SimpleResult` struct and what does it contain?
- The `SimpleResult` struct contains a key, value, a merkle proof, and the root hash of a tree. It is used to build the confio/proof.

2. What is the purpose of the `GenerateRangeProof` function and what does it return?
- The `GenerateRangeProof` function creates a map of random key/value pairs, builds a tree from the map, and returns a range proof and the root hash of the tree for one random element.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetNonKey` function and what does it return?
- The `GetNonKey` function returns a missing key that is either to the left of all keys, to the right of all keys, or next to an existing key. It is used to test the range proof with a key that is not in the original map.
