The `maps` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains two types of maps: `merkleMap` and `simpleMap`. Both maps are used to create a Merkle tree from a map, where the leaves are `hash(key) | hash(value)`. The leaves are sorted before Merkle hashing. 

The `merkleMap` type is a Merkle-ized tree from a map. The `set` method creates a `kv.Pair` from the provided key and value. The value is hashed prior to creating a `kv.Pair`. The created `kv.Pair` is appended to the `merkleMap`'s slice of `kv.Pairs`. Whenever called, the `merkleMap` must be resorted. The `hash` method returns the Merkle root of items sorted by key. Note that it is unstable.

The `simpleMap` type is a Merkle tree from a map. The `Set` method creates a `kv.Pair` of the key and the hash of the value, and then appends it to `simpleMap`'s `kv.Pairs`. The `Hash` method returns the Merkle root hash of items sorted by key (and by value too if duplicate key). The `KVPairs` method returns a copy of sorted `KVPairs`. Note that these contain the hashed key and value.

The `KVPair` type is a local extension to `kv.Pair` that can be hashed. The `NewKVPair` method takes in a key and value and creates a `kv.Pair` wrapped in the local extension `KVPair`. The `Bytes` method returns `key || value`, with both the key and value length prefixed.

The `HashFromMap` function computes a Merkle tree from a sorted map and returns the Merkle root. The `ProofsFromMap` function generates proofs from a map. The keys/values of the map will be used as the keys/values in the underlying key-value pairs. The keys are sorted before the proofs are computed. The function returns the root hash, proofs, and keys.

Overall, the `maps` package provides functionality for creating Merkle trees from maps and generating proofs from maps. These features are useful for various applications, such as verifying the integrity of data stored in a distributed system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `merkleMap` and `simpleMap` structs?
- The `merkleMap` and `simpleMap` structs are used to create a merkle-ized tree from a map, where the leaves are treated as `hash(key) | hash(value)` and sorted before Merkle hashing.

2. What is the purpose of the `KVPair` struct and its `Bytes` method?
- The `KVPair` struct is a local extension to `kv.Pair` that can be hashed. Its `Bytes` method returns `key || value`, with both the key and value length prefixed, so that it can be hashed.

3. What is the purpose of the `HashFromMap` and `ProofsFromMap` functions?
- The `HashFromMap` function computes a merkle tree from a sorted map and returns the merkle root. 
- The `ProofsFromMap` function generates proofs from a map, where the keys/values of the map are used as the keys/values in the underlying key-value pairs. The keys are sorted before the proofs are computed, and the function returns the root hash, proofs, and keys.
