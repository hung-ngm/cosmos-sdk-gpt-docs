The `RegisterSwaggerAPI` function in the `server` package of the `cosmos-sdk` project provides a common way to register a Swagger route with the API server. Swagger is a tool for documenting and testing APIs, and the Swagger UI is a web-based interface for exploring and interacting with an API.

The function takes three arguments: a `client.Context` object, a `mux.Router` object, and a boolean flag indicating whether Swagger is enabled. If Swagger is not enabled, the function returns `nil` and does nothing. If Swagger is enabled, the function loads the Swagger UI files from the `docs.SwaggerUI` directory using the `fs.Sub` function, which returns a `fs.FS` object representing the subdirectory. It then creates an `http.FileServer` object using the `http.FS` function and the subdirectory, and registers a route on the `mux.Router` object using the `PathPrefix` and `Handler` methods. The route matches any URL starting with `/swagger/` and strips that prefix before serving files from the `http.FileServer`.

This function is useful for any API server built with the `cosmos-sdk` framework that wants to provide a Swagger UI for its users. By calling this function with the appropriate arguments, the server can easily register a route for the Swagger UI and serve the necessary files. For example, a server might call this function in its `main` function like this:

```go
func main() {
    ctx := client.Context{} // create a client context
    rtr := mux.NewRouter() // create a router
    swaggerEnabled := true // enable Swagger
    err := server.RegisterSwaggerAPI(ctx, rtr, swaggerEnabled) // register the Swagger route
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    // ... add other routes to the router ...
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", rtr) // start the server
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides a function called `RegisterSwaggerAPI` which registers a swagger route with an API server.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code imports the following packages: `io/fs`, `net/http`, `github.com/gorilla/mux`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/client`, and `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/client/docs`.

3. What does the `swaggerEnabled` boolean do?
    
    The `swaggerEnabled` boolean is used to determine whether or not to register the swagger route with the API server. If it is set to `false`, the function returns without registering the route.
