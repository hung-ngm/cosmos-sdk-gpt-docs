The `server` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to running a Cosmos SDK application server. This particular file contains a function called `GetPruningOptionsFromFlags` that is responsible for parsing command flags and returning the correct `PruningOptions` for the application.

The `PruningOptions` type is defined in the `pruning/types` package and is used to specify how the application's state should be pruned. Pruning is the process of removing old, unnecessary data from the application's state to reduce its size and improve performance.

The `GetPruningOptionsFromFlags` function takes an `AppOptions` parameter, which is a type defined in the `server/types` package. This parameter contains the command-line flags passed to the application when it starts up. The function first extracts the value of the `FlagPruning` flag, which specifies the pruning strategy to use.

If the pruning strategy is one of the predefined options (`PruningOptionDefault`, `PruningOptionNothing`, or `PruningOptionEverything`), the function creates a new `PruningOptions` object using the `NewPruningOptionsFromString` function and returns it.

If the pruning strategy is `PruningOptionCustom`, the function creates a new `CustomPruningOptions` object using the `NewCustomPruningOptions` function and sets its `KeepRecent` and `Interval` fields based on the values of the `FlagPruningKeepRecent` and `FlagPruningInterval` flags, respectively. It then calls the `Validate` method on the `CustomPruningOptions` object to ensure that the values are valid. If validation fails, the function returns an error.

If the pruning strategy is not recognized, the function returns an error.

Overall, this function is an important part of the Cosmos SDK application server, as it allows developers to specify how the application's state should be pruned based on command-line flags. Here is an example of how this function might be used in a larger application:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/server"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/server/types"
    "cosmossdk.io/store/pruning/types"
)

func main() {
    appOpts := types.NewAppOptions()
    appOpts.Set(server.FlagPruning, "custom")
    appOpts.Set(server.FlagPruningKeepRecent, "100")
    appOpts.Set(server.FlagPruningInterval, "10")

    pruningOpts, err := server.GetPruningOptionsFromFlags(appOpts)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }

    // use pruningOpts to configure state pruning
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a function called `GetPruningOptionsFromFlags` that parses command flags and returns the correct pruning options for a given strategy.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code imports `cast` and `types` from the `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/server` package, as well as `PruningOptions` from `cosmossdk.io/store/pruning/types`.
3. What input does the `GetPruningOptionsFromFlags` function take and what does it return?
   - The function takes an `AppOptions` object as input and returns a `PruningOptions` object and an error.
