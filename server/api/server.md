The `api` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains the implementation of the server's API interface. The `Server` struct defines the API server and its properties. The `Start` method starts the API server and delegates the configuration options to the CometBFT JSON RPC server. The `Close` method closes the API server. The `SetTelemetry` method sets the telemetry metrics for the server.

The `New` function creates a new instance of the `Server` struct and returns it. It takes the `clientCtx` context, `logger` instance, and `grpcSrv` server as input parameters. The `CustomGRPCHeaderMatcher` function maps the request headers to GRPC metadata. The `marshalerOption` variable is used to marshal the scalar field in the gRPC-Gateway. The `Server` struct has the following properties:

- `Router`: The router instance for the API server.
- `GRPCGatewayRouter`: The router instance for the gRPC-Gateway server.
- `ClientCtx`: The client context instance.
- `GRPCSrv`: The gRPC server instance.
- `logger`: The logger instance.
- `metrics`: The telemetry metrics instance.
- `mtx`: The mutex instance to avoid data races.

The `Start` method starts the API server and delegates the configuration options to the CometBFT JSON RPC server. It takes the `ctx` context and `cfg` configuration as input parameters. The `Close` method closes the API server. The `SetTelemetry` method sets the telemetry metrics for the server. The `registerMetrics` method registers the metrics handler for the server.

The `writeErrorResponse` function prepares and writes an HTTP error given a status code and an error message. The `newErrorResponse` function creates a new error response instance. The `CustomGRPCHeaderMatcher` function maps the request headers to GRPC metadata. The `marshalerOption` variable is used to marshal the scalar field in the gRPC-Gateway.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Server` struct and what are its main components?
- The `Server` struct defines the server's API interface and contains a `mux.Router`, `runtime.ServeMux`, `client.Context`, `grpc.Server`, `log.Logger`, and `telemetry.Metrics`.

2. What is the purpose of the `CustomGRPCHeaderMatcher` function and when would it be used?
- The `CustomGRPCHeaderMatcher` function is used to map request headers to GRPC metadata. It would be used when HTTP headers do not start with `Grpc-Metadata-`.

3. What is the purpose of the `Start` function and what does it do?
- The `Start` function starts the API server and leverages CometBFT's JSON RPC server. It creates a blocking process if the server is started successfully and returns an error otherwise. The caller is expected to provide a context that is properly canceled or closed to indicate the server should be stopped.
