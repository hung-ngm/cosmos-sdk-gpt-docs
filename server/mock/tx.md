The `mock` package contains a mock implementation of a key-value store transaction (`KVStoreTx`) and a dummy implementation of a public key (`testPubKey`) used for testing purposes. The `KVStoreTx` struct is an implementation of the `sdk.Tx` and `sdk.Msg` interfaces, and it is also a `signing.SigVerifiableTx` and `cryptotypes.PubKey`. 

The `KVStoreTx` struct represents a transaction that stores a key-value pair in a key-value store. The `NewTx` function creates a new instance of `KVStoreTx` with the given key, value, and account address. The `Type` function returns the type of the transaction, which is `kvstore_tx`. The `GetMsgs` function returns an array of `sdk.Msg` containing only the current transaction. The `GetSignBytes` function returns the bytes to be signed by the signers. The `ValidateBasic` function validates the basic fields of the transaction. The `GetSigners` function returns an array of account addresses that must sign the transaction. The `GetPubKeys` function returns an array of public keys that correspond to the signers of the transaction.

The `testPubKey` struct is a dummy implementation of `cryptotypes.PubKey` used for testing purposes. It has a single field `address` of type `sdk.AccAddress`, which is used to generate the address of the public key.

The `decodeTx` function takes raw transaction bytes and decodes them into an `sdk.Tx`. It splits the bytes by the `=` character and creates a new instance of `KVStoreTx` with the key and value obtained from the split. If there are more than two `=` characters in the bytes, an error is returned.

This code is used to test the transaction handling functionality of the `cosmos-sdk` project. It provides a mock implementation of a key-value store transaction and a dummy implementation of a public key for testing purposes. The `decodeTx` function is used to decode raw transaction bytes into an `sdk.Tx` that can be used to authenticate the transaction.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `KVStoreTx` struct?

2. What is the purpose of the `testPubKey` struct?
- The `testPubKey` struct is a dummy implementation of `cryptotypes.PubKey` used for testing.

3. What is the purpose of the `decodeTx` function?
- The `decodeTx` function takes raw transaction bytes and decodes them into an `sdk.Tx` that can be used to authenticate.
