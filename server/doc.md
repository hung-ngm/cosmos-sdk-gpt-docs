This code defines the `InterceptConfigsPreRunHandler` function which is responsible for configuring the commands from the Cosmos SDK using the `cobra` and `viper` packages. The `viper` package is used for configuration and determines the precedence of configuration sources, which are command line switches, environment variables, files from configuration values, and default values.

In this function, a new instance of `viper.Viper` is created and the environmental variable prefix is set to the current program name. This means that configuration values are read from environmental variables with names that are derived from the program name and the configuration value name. For example, a configuration value called `rpc.laddr` would be read from an environmental variable called `MYTOOL_RPC_LADDR` if the current program name is `mytool`.

The `InterceptConfigsPreRunHandler` function also reads `app.toml` and `config.toml` from the home directory under the `config` directory. If these files do not exist, they are created and populated with default values. The function takes two parameters to set/update a custom template to create a custom `app.toml`. If these parameters are empty, the server creates a default template provided by the SDK.

Overall, this function is an important part of the Cosmos SDK as it handles the configuration of commands using the `viper` package and ensures that the necessary configuration files exist and are populated with default values if they do not exist. This function can be used by developers who are building applications using the Cosmos SDK to ensure that their commands are properly configured and that the necessary configuration files exist. 

Example usage:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/server"
)

func main() {
    // configure commands using InterceptConfigsPreRunHandler
    server.InterceptConfigsPreRunHandler()
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InterceptConfigsPreRunHandler` function?
- The `InterceptConfigsPreRunHandler` function is responsible for defining and configuring commands using `cobra` and `viper` packages.

2. How does the `viper` package determine the precedence of configuration values?
- The precedence of configuration values is determined by the `viper` package in the following order: command line switches, environment variables, files from configuration values, and default values.

3. What files are read and created by the `InterceptConfigsPreRunHandler` function?
- The `InterceptConfigsPreRunHandler` function reads `app.toml` and `config.toml` from the home directory under the `config` directory. If these files do not exist, they are created and populated with default values. Additionally, the function takes two parameters to set/update a custom template to create a custom `app.toml`. If these parameters are empty, the server creates a default template provided by the SDK.
