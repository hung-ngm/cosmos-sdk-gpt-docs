The `server` package contains various commands and utilities for running a CometBFT node. The code in this file defines several Cobra commands that can be used to interact with the node.

The `ShowNodeIDCmd` command prints the node ID to stdout. It loads the node key from the configuration file and prints the ID associated with it.

The `ShowValidatorCmd` command prints the validator information for the node. It loads the private validator key from the configuration file and prints the public key associated with it.

The `ShowAddressCmd` command prints the validator consensus address for the node. It loads the private validator key from the configuration file and prints the address associated with it.

The `VersionCmd` command prints the version numbers for the CometBFT and ABCI libraries that the node has been compiled against.

The `QueryBlocksCmd` command allows the user to search for blocks that match a set of events. The events query is passed directly to CometBFT's RPC BlockSearch method and must conform to CometBFT's query syntax.

The `QueryBlockCmd` command allows the user to query for a specific committed block using the CometBFT RPC `block` and `block_by_hash` methods. The user can specify whether to query by height or hash.

These commands can be used to interact with a CometBFT node and retrieve information about the node and the blocks it has processed. For example, a user could use the `ShowNodeIDCmd` command to retrieve the node ID and then use that ID to connect to the node and send it messages. The `QueryBlocksCmd` command could be used to search for blocks that contain specific events, while the `QueryBlockCmd` command could be used to retrieve information about a specific block.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ShowNodeIDCmd` function?
- The `ShowNodeIDCmd` function is used to create a Cobra command that, when executed, prints the ID of the node to stdout.

2. What is the purpose of the `QueryBlockCmd` function?
- The `QueryBlockCmd` function is used to create a Cobra command that, when executed, queries for a committed block by height, hash, or event(s) using the CometBFT RPC `block` and `block_by_hash` method.

3. What is the purpose of the `VersionCmd` function?
- The `VersionCmd` function is used to create a Cobra command that, when executed, prints the version numbers of the CometBFT and ABCI libraries against which the app has been compiled.
