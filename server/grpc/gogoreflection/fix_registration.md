The `gogoreflection` package provides utility functions for working with Go protocol buffers and GoGo protocol buffers. Protocol buffers are a language-agnostic data serialization format used for communication between different systems. GoGo protocol buffers are a faster and more efficient implementation of protocol buffers in Go.

The `getFileDescriptor` function takes a file path as input and returns the file descriptor for that file. It first checks the gogoproto registry for the file descriptor and if it is not found, it checks the proto registry. This function is useful for getting the file descriptor for a specific protocol buffer file.

The `getMessageType` function takes a message name as input and returns the reflect type for that message. It first checks the gogoproto registry for the message type and if it is not found, it checks the proto registry. This function is useful for getting the reflect type for a specific protocol buffer message.

The `getExtension` function takes an extension ID and a protocol buffer message as input and returns the extension descriptor for that extension. It first checks the gogoproto registry for the extension descriptor and if it is not found, it checks the proto registry. This function is useful for getting the extension descriptor for a specific extension in a protocol buffer message.

The `getExtensionsNumbers` function takes a protocol buffer message as input and returns a slice of extension IDs for that message. It first checks the gogoproto registry for the extension IDs and if it is not found, it checks the proto registry. This function is useful for getting a list of extension IDs for a specific protocol buffer message.

Overall, these utility functions are useful for working with protocol buffers and GoGo protocol buffers in Go. They provide a way to get file descriptors, message types, and extension descriptors for specific protocol buffer files and messages. These functions can be used in the larger project to facilitate working with protocol buffers and GoGo protocol buffers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this package and what problem does it solve?
- This package provides functions for getting file descriptors, message types, and extensions for protobuf messages. It solves the problem of needing to access this information in a convenient way.

2. What dependencies does this package have?
- This package depends on `github.com/cosmos/gogoproto/gogoproto`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto`, and `github.com/golang/protobuf/proto`.

3. What is the difference between `gogoproto` and `proto` in this code?
- `gogoproto` is a package that provides extensions to the protobuf language, while `proto` is the standard protobuf package. The code in this package uses both `gogoproto` and `proto` to access file descriptors, message types, and extensions.
