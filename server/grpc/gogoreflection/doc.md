The `gogoreflection` package is responsible for implementing gRPC reflection for gogoproto consumers. This is necessary because the normal reflection library does not work as it points to a different singleton registry. The API and codebase for this package is taken from the official gRPC reflection repository.

gRPC reflection is a feature that allows clients to query a gRPC server for information about the server's services, methods, and message types. This is useful for debugging and testing purposes, as well as for dynamically generating client code.

The `gogoreflection` package specifically implements reflection for gogoproto consumers. Gogoproto is a protocol buffer compiler plugin that generates faster and smaller protocol buffer code. By implementing reflection for gogoproto consumers, this package allows clients to query a gRPC server that uses gogoproto-generated code.

One example of how this package may be used in the larger project is in the development of a gRPC client that needs to dynamically generate code based on the server's services and message types. The client can use the reflection API provided by this package to query the server for this information and then generate the necessary code at runtime.

Overall, the `gogoreflection` package is an important component of the cosmos-sdk project as it enables gRPC reflection for gogoproto consumers, which is necessary for dynamic code generation and other debugging and testing purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this package and how does it relate to gRPC reflection?
- This package implements gRPC reflection for gogoproto consumers, as the normal reflection library does not work due to pointing to a different singleton registry. The codebase is taken from the official gRPC reflection repository.

2. What is gogoproto and how does it differ from normal protobuf?
- The code mentions gogoproto consumers, which suggests the use of the gogoproto extension for protobuf. Gogoproto provides additional features and optimizations not found in normal protobuf, such as optional fields and custom types.

3. Are there any potential issues or limitations with using this package for gRPC reflection?
- The code does not mention any specific issues or limitations, but it is worth noting that gRPC reflection can have security implications and should be used with caution in production environments. Additionally, the use of gogoproto may introduce compatibility issues with other protobuf implementations.
