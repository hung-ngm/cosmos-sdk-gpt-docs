The `v2alpha1` package contains code for the Cosmos SDK reflection service. The `Register` function in this package registers the reflection service to a provided `grpc.Server` given a `Config`. The `Config` struct contains the signing modes, chain ID, SDK configuration, and interface registry. 

The `reflectionServiceServer` struct contains methods that return the descriptors for various components of the Cosmos SDK. These methods include `GetAuthnDescriptor`, `GetChainDescriptor`, `GetCodecDescriptor`, `GetConfigurationDescriptor`, `GetQueryServicesDescriptor`, and `GetTxDescriptor`. Each of these methods returns a descriptor for the corresponding component of the Cosmos SDK. 

The `newReflectionServiceServer` function creates a new reflection service server given a `grpc.Server` and a `Config`. It creates the descriptors for the various components of the Cosmos SDK and returns a `reflectionServiceServer` struct containing these descriptors. 

The `newCodecDescriptor` function describes the codec given the `codectypes.InterfaceRegistry`. It creates a list of interface descriptors and their implementers. 

The `newQueryServiceDescriptor` function creates a descriptor for the query services provided by the `grpc.Server`. It creates a list of query service descriptors, each containing a list of query method descriptors. 

The `newTxDescriptor` function creates a descriptor for the transaction types provided by the Cosmos SDK. It creates a list of message descriptors for each transaction type. 

The `newAuthnDescriptor` function creates a descriptor for the authentication modes provided by the Cosmos SDK. It creates a list of signing mode descriptors, each containing the name and number of the signing mode. 

Overall, this package provides a reflection service for the Cosmos SDK that allows clients to retrieve descriptors for various components of the SDK. These descriptors can be used to generate code or documentation for the SDK.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Config` struct and what are its fields used for?
- The `Config` struct is used to store various configuration options for the reflection service. Its fields include `SigningModes` which is a map of signing modes to their corresponding integer values, `ChainID` which is a string representing the chain ID, `SdkConfig` which is a pointer to an SDK configuration object, and `InterfaceRegistry` which is an interface registry used for serialization and deserialization.

2. What is the purpose of the `reflectionServiceServer` struct and what methods does it implement?
- The `reflectionServiceServer` struct is used to implement the reflection service API. It has methods for retrieving information about the authentication, chain, codec, configuration, query services, and transactions of the application.

3. What is the purpose of the `newCodecDescriptor` function and what does it return?
- The `newCodecDescriptor` function is used to create a descriptor for the codec used by the application. It takes an interface registry as input and returns a `CodecDescriptor` object which contains information about the interfaces and their implementers that are registered with the registry.
