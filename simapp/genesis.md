The `simapp` package contains code related to the simulation of the Cosmos SDK blockchain. Within this package, the `GenesisState` type is defined. This type represents the initial state of the blockchain and is stored as a map of raw JSON messages, with each message being identified by a unique string.

The purpose of this type is to allow for the storage and retrieval of module-specific genesis information. During the initialization of the blockchain, each module can provide its own default genesis information in the form of a `BasicModule` object. The `ModuleBasicManager` then populates the `GenesisState` map with the JSON representation of each `BasicModule` object.

This `GenesisState` type is used throughout the Cosmos SDK to store and retrieve the initial state of the blockchain. For example, it is used in the `InitGenesis` function of each module to retrieve the module-specific genesis information and initialize the module's state accordingly.

Here is an example of how the `GenesisState` type might be used in a module's `InitGenesis` function:

```go
func InitGenesis(ctx sdk.Context, keeper Keeper, data GenesisState) {
    // Retrieve the module-specific genesis information from the GenesisState
    myModuleGenesis := data["myModule"]

    // Unmarshal the JSON into a struct
    var myModuleState MyModuleState
    err := json.Unmarshal(myModuleGenesis, &myModuleState)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Initialize the module's state using the retrieved genesis information
    keeper.SetMyModuleState(ctx, myModuleState)
}
```

In summary, the `GenesisState` type is a key component of the Cosmos SDK's initialization process, allowing for the storage and retrieval of module-specific genesis information.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the GenesisState type?
   - The GenesisState type represents the initial state of the blockchain and is a map of raw JSON messages keyed by an identifier string. It is used to determine which module genesis information belongs to so it may be appropriately routed during init chain.

2. How is default genesis information retrieved within this application?
   - Within this application, default genesis information is retrieved from the ModuleBasicManager which populates JSON from each BasicModule object provided to it during init.

3. What is the significance of using json.RawMessage in the GenesisState type?
   - The use of json.RawMessage in the GenesisState type allows for the raw JSON data to be stored without being parsed, which can be useful for modules that require custom unmarshaling logic.
