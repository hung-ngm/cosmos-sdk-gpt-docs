This code defines a function called `MakeTestEncodingConfig` that creates an `EncodingConfig` object for a non-amino based test configuration. The `EncodingConfig` object contains several fields, including an interface registry, a codec, a transaction configuration, and an amino codec. 

The purpose of this function is to provide a way to create an `EncodingConfig` object for testing purposes that does not rely on the amino codec. The amino codec is a legacy codec used in earlier versions of the Cosmos SDK, but has since been replaced by a more efficient protobuf-based codec. 

The `MakeTestEncodingConfig` function creates a new legacy amino codec using `codec.NewLegacyAmino()`, as well as a new protobuf-based codec using `codec.NewProtoCodec()`. It then creates a new `EncodingConfig` object using these codecs, along with a new interface registry and a transaction configuration. 

This function is intended to be used only internally within the SDK, and is marked as deprecated. App users should not create new codecs using this function, but should instead use the `AppCodec` provided by the SDK. 

Here is an example of how this function might be used within the SDK:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/codec"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/auth/tx"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/params"
)

func MyTestFunction() {
    // Create a new test encoding config
    cfg := params.MakeTestEncodingConfig()

    // Use the codec to encode some data
    data := MyData{...}
    encoded, err := cfg.Codec.MarshalBinaryBare(data)
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }

    // Use the transaction config to create a new transaction
    txBuilder := tx.NewTxBuilder(cfg.TxConfig, ...)
    txBuilder.SetMsgs(...)
    txBuilder.SetFeeAmount(...)
    txBuilder.SetGasLimit(...)
    txBuilder.SetMemo(...)
    txBytes, err := txBuilder.BuildAndSign(...)
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }

    // ...
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this file and what package does it belong to?
- This file belongs to the `params` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project and contains a function for creating an encoding configuration for non-amino based tests.

2. What is the difference between `codec.NewLegacyAmino()` and `codec.NewProtoCodec(interfaceRegistry)`?
- `codec.NewLegacyAmino()` creates a codec that uses the legacy amino encoding format, while `codec.NewProtoCodec(interfaceRegistry)` creates a codec that uses the protobuf encoding format and requires an interface registry to be passed in.

3. Why is the `MakeTestEncodingConfig()` function deprecated and what should be used instead?
- The function is deprecated because it is only intended for internal use within the SDK. App users should use the `app.AppCodec` instead of creating new codecs.
