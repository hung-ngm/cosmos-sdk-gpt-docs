The code defines an on-chain upgrade for the sample SimApp in the cosmos-sdk project. The upgrade is from version v0.47.x to v0.48.x. The purpose of the code is to register upgrade handlers and configure store upgrades for the SimApp.

The `UpgradeName` constant defines the name of the upgrade. The `RegisterUpgradeHandlers` function registers the upgrade handler for the upgrade name. The upgrade handler is a function that takes a context, an upgrade plan, and a version map as input and returns a version map and an error. The function runs migrations using the module manager and the configurator of the SimApp.

The function also reads the upgrade information from disk using the `UpgradeKeeper` and checks if the upgrade name matches the defined upgrade name and if the upgrade height is not skipped. If the conditions are met, the function configures the store loader to apply store upgrades.

This code is used in the larger cosmos-sdk project to manage upgrades for the SimApp. It provides a reference implementation of how an upgrade could look like when an application is migrating from one version of the cosmos-sdk to another. The code can be customized for different applications and upgrades by changing the upgrade name and the upgrade handler function.

Example usage:

```
app := SimApp{}
app.RegisterUpgradeHandlers()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RegisterUpgradeHandlers` function?
   
   The `RegisterUpgradeHandlers` function is used to register an upgrade handler for the `SimApp` and configure a store loader for the upgrade.

2. What is the `UpgradeName` constant used for?
   
   The `UpgradeName` constant defines the name of the on-chain upgrade for the sample `SimApp` upgrade from v047 to v048.

3. What is the `storeUpgrades` variable used for?
   
   The `storeUpgrades` variable is used to store the store upgrades that will be applied during the upgrade process.
