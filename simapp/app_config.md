This code defines the application configuration for the cosmos-sdk project. It sets up the various modules that the project uses and specifies their configurations. The `AppConfig` variable is used by the dependency injection system to provide the necessary configurations to the modules.

The code imports various modules from the cosmos-sdk project, such as `auth`, `bank`, `staking`, `slashing`, `params`, `genutil`, `authz`, `upgrade`, `distribution`, `evidence`, `mint`, `group`, `nft`, `feegrant`, `gov`, `crisis`, and `consensus`. It also imports some types from these modules.

The `AppConfig` variable is a composition of various `ModuleConfig` objects. Each `ModuleConfig` object specifies the name of the module and its configuration. The `Modules` field of the `Config` object specifies an array of `ModuleConfig` objects.

For example, the `auth` module is configured with a `ModuleAccountPermission` object that specifies the permissions for various module accounts. The `bank` module is configured with a list of blocked account addresses. The `staking` module is configured with a `Module` object that specifies the configuration for the module.

The `InitGenesis` field of the `Module` object specifies the order in which the modules should be initialized during genesis. The `BeginBlockers` and `EndBlockers` fields specify the order in which the modules should be called during the begin and end block phases.

Overall, this code sets up the necessary configurations for the various modules used in the cosmos-sdk project. It provides a high-level view of how the modules interact with each other and how they should be initialized.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `moduleAccPerms` variable?
- `moduleAccPerms` is a list of module account permissions that define which accounts have access to certain actions within the application.

2. What is the significance of the `BeginBlockers` and `EndBlockers` fields in the `runtimev1alpha1.Module` configuration?
- `BeginBlockers` and `EndBlockers` are lists of module names that define the order in which modules are executed during the begin and end block phases of the application.

3. What is the purpose of the `AppConfig` variable?
- `AppConfig` is a composite of various module configurations that define the behavior and functionality of the application. It is used by the depinject package to inject dependencies into the application.
