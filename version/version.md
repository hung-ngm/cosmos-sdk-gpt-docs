The `version` package provides a utility for SDK consumers to easily add a version command to their application. This command produces versioning information based on flags passed at compile time. The package exports an `Info` struct that defines the application version information. The `NewInfo` function creates a new `Info` struct with the version information based on the values of the `Name`, `AppName`, `Version`, `Commit`, and `BuildTags` variables. The `String` method of the `Info` struct returns a formatted string with the version information. 

The `version` package can be used in the larger project to provide versioning information for the SDK and applications built on top of it. By adding the version command to the root command of an application, users can easily retrieve version information for the application. The `Info` struct can also be used to provide version information in other parts of the application, such as in the application's logs or user interface. 

Here is an example of how to use the `version` package to add a version command to a Cobra application:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
	"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/version"
)

func main() {
	rootCmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "myapp",
		Short: "My application",
	}

	rootCmd.AddCommand(version.NewVersionCommand())

	if err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

This code creates a new Cobra root command and adds the version command provided by the `version` package. When the user runs `myapp version`, the version information for the application is printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `version` package?
- The `version` package provides a version command that produces apps versioning information based on flags passed at compile time.

2. What variables can be passed as build flags to configure the version command?
- The variables that can be passed as build flags to configure the version command are `Name`, `AppName`, `Version`, `Commit`, and `BuildTags`.

3. What is the purpose of the `getSDKVersion` function?
- The `getSDKVersion` function reads the build information and returns the version of the `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk` dependency.
