The `version` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains a CLI command that prints the application binary version information. This package is used to provide version information about the application to the user. The `NewVersionCommand` function returns a `cobra.Command` object that can be used to interactively print the version information.

The `NewVersionCommand` function takes no arguments and returns a `cobra.Command` object. The `cobra.Command` object is used to define the command-line interface for the `version` command. The `Use` field is set to "version", which is the name of the command. The `Short` field is set to "Print the application binary version information", which is a brief description of what the command does. The `Args` field is set to `cobra.NoArgs`, which means that the command takes no arguments.

The `RunE` field is set to a function that is called when the `version` command is executed. The function first creates a `verInfo` object using the `NewInfo` function. If the `--long` flag is not set, the function prints the version number to the console and returns. If the `--long` flag is set, the function marshals the `verInfo` object to either JSON or YAML format based on the `--output` flag. The marshaled data is then printed to the console.

The `--long` flag is used to print additional information about the application, such as the commit hash and build date. The `--output` flag is used to specify the output format. The default output format is `text`, but the user can also choose `json` or `yaml`.

Here is an example of how to use the `version` command:

```
$ myapp version
v1.0.0

$ myapp version --long
version: v1.0.0
commit: 123abc
build date: 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z

$ myapp version --output=json
{"version":"v1.0.0","commit":"123abc","build_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"}

$ myapp version --output=yaml
version: v1.0.0
commit: 123abc
build_date: '2022-01-01T00:00:00Z'
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a CLI command for printing the version information of an application binary.

2. What are the available output formats for the version information?
- The available output formats are "text" (default) and "json", which can be specified using the `--output` flag.

3. What is the difference between the short and long version information?
- The short version information only prints the version number, while the long version information includes additional details such as the Git commit hash and build date. The long version information can be printed by specifying the `--long` flag.
