The `errors` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains a function called `AssertNil`. This function is used to panic if an error is encountered. It is intended to be used with interface methods that require a return error, but the error is always expected to be nil. 

The purpose of this function is to catch unexpected errors that should never occur in the code. If an error is encountered, it is assumed to be a logic error and the function panics with a formatted error message. 

Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
func MyInterfaceMethod() error {
	// do some logic
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// call another method that should never return an error
	otherErr := SomeOtherMethod()
	errors.AssertNil(otherErr)

	// continue with logic
	return nil
}
```

In this example, `MyInterfaceMethod` is expected to return an error if something goes wrong. However, the `SomeOtherMethod` method is expected to never return an error. If an error is encountered, it is considered a logic error and the `AssertNil` function is used to panic and alert the developer that something unexpected has occurred. 

Overall, the `AssertNil` function is a useful tool for catching unexpected errors in code and ensuring that they are addressed appropriately.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the AssertNil function?
   - The AssertNil function is used to panic on error and should only be used with interface methods that require a return error, but the error is always nil.

2. When should the AssertNil function be used?
   - The AssertNil function should only be used with interface methods that require a return error, but the error is always nil.

3. What happens when an error is passed to the AssertNil function?
   - If an error is passed to the AssertNil function, it will panic with a formatted error message that indicates a logic error that should never happen.
