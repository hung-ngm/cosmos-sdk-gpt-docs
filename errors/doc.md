The `errors` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project implements custom error interfaces. The purpose of this package is to provide a broad range of error declarations that cover common cases. Each error instance can wrap a generic error declaration to provide more details. 

To create a new error instance, the `Register` function is used. This function requires a unique, non-zero error code and a short description. For example, `var ErrZeroDivision = errors.Register(9241, "zero division")`. 

When returning an error, additional context information can be attached to it using the `Wrap` function. This function takes the error instance and a string message as arguments. For example, `errors.Wrapf(ErrZeroDivision, "cannot divide %d", val)`. 

The first time an error instance is wrapped, a stacktrace is attached to it. Stacktrace information can be printed using `%+v` and `%v` formats. `%s` is used to print just the error message, while `%+v` is used to print the full stack trace. `%v` appends a compressed `[filename:line]` where the error was created. 

Overall, the `errors` package provides a way to create and handle errors in a consistent and organized manner. It allows for easy addition of new error declarations and provides a way to attach additional context information to errors. This package is likely used throughout the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to handle errors in a standardized way. 

Example usage:

```
var ErrZeroDivision = errors.Register(9241, "zero division")

func safeDiv(val, div int) (int, err) {
    if div == 0 {
        return 0, errors.Wrapf(ErrZeroDivision, "cannot divide %d", val)
    }
    return val / div, nil
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `errors` package in cosmos-sdk?
- The `errors` package implements custom error interfaces for cosmos-sdk and provides a broad range of errors declared that fits all common cases.

2. How can a developer create a new error instance using the `errors` package?
- To create a new error instance, a developer can use the `Register` function and provide a unique, non-zero error code and a short description.

3. How can a developer attach additional context information to an error using the `errors` package?
- A developer can attach additional context information to an error by using the `Wrap` function when returning an error. This function allows the developer to attach context information to the error instance.
