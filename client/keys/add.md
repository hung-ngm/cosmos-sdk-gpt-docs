The `keys` package provides functionality for managing keys in the Cosmos SDK. The `AddKeyCommand` function defines a command to add a new encrypted private key to the keybase. The command can either generate a new key or recover an existing one. The key is encrypted with a local password and saved to a file with the given name. The command can also be used to create and store a multisig key by passing the list of key names stored in a keyring and the minimum number of signatures required. 

The `runAddCmdPrepare` function gets the client context and prepares to run the `runAddCmd` function. The `runAddCmd` function takes input from the user, such as the BIP39 mnemonic, passphrase, and HD path, and generates a new private key. If the `--recover` flag is set, the function recovers an existing key from the seed passphrase. The function then saves the key to the keybase and prints the key information to the console. 

The `printCreate` function prints the key information to the console in either text or JSON format. If the `showMnemonic` flag is set, the function also prints the mnemonic phrase to the console. 

Overall, this package provides a convenient way to manage keys in the Cosmos SDK and allows users to easily generate and store new private keys.
