The `keys` package provides functionality for managing cryptographic keys in the Cosmos SDK. This file contains two commands for listing keys and key types respectively.

The `ListKeysCmd` command lists all public keys stored in the key store along with their associated name and address. It takes an optional flag `-n` or `--list-names` to list only the names of the keys. When executed, it retrieves the client query context and uses it to get a list of all key records from the keyring. If the list is empty, it prints a message to the console and returns. Otherwise, it either prints the full key records or just the names depending on the value of the `-n` flag.

Example usage:
```
$ gaiacli keys list
$ gaiacli keys list --list-names
```

The `ListKeyTypesCmd` command lists all supported key types (also known as algorithms) that can be used to generate cryptographic keys. When executed, it retrieves the client query context and uses it to get a list of all supported algorithms from the keyring. It then prints the list to the console.

Example usage:
```
$ gaiacli keys list-key-types
```

These commands are useful for managing keys in the Cosmos SDK. They can be used by developers to retrieve information about the keys stored in the keyring and the supported key types. This information can be used to make decisions about which keys to use for signing transactions or to generate new keys.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ListKeysCmd` function?
- The `ListKeysCmd` function returns a Cobra command that lists all public keys stored by the key manager along with their associated name and address.

2. What is the purpose of the `flagListNames` constant?
- The `flagListNames` constant is used to define the name of the flag that, when set to true, causes the `ListKeysCmd` function to only list the names of the keys instead of their associated addresses.

3. What is the purpose of the `ListKeyTypesCmd` function?
- The `ListKeyTypesCmd` function returns a Cobra command that lists all supported key types (also known as algos).
