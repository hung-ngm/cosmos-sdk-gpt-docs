This file contains functions related to printing keyring records in different formats. The `cryptokeyring` package is used to manage keyrings, which are collections of keys that can be used for signing transactions or messages. The `printKeyringRecord` function takes a single keyring record and a function that converts the record to a `KeyOutput` struct. It then prints the keyring record in the specified output format (either text or JSON) to the given writer. The `printKeyringRecords` function takes a slice of keyring records and uses the `MkAccKeysOutput` function to convert them to a slice of `KeyOutput` structs. It then prints the slice of `KeyOutput` structs in the specified output format to the given writer.

The `KeyOutput` struct represents a key in a human-readable format. It contains fields for the key name, type, address, and public key. The `bechKeyOutFn` type is a function that takes a keyring record and returns a `KeyOutput` struct. This allows the caller to specify how the key should be formatted.

The `printTextRecords` function takes a slice of `KeyOutput` structs and prints them in YAML format to the given writer. This function is used to print keyring records in text format.

Overall, these functions provide a way to print keyring records in different formats, which can be useful for debugging or displaying information to users. For example, the `printKeyringRecords` function could be used to display a list of all keys in a keyring to the user, while the `printKeyringRecord` function could be used to display detailed information about a specific key. The ability to print keyring records in different formats makes the `cosmos-sdk` project more flexible and user-friendly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `printKeyringRecord` function?
- The `printKeyringRecord` function takes a `cryptokeyring.Record` and prints it to the specified output format (`flags.OutputFormatText` or `flags.OutputFormatJSON`) using the provided `bechKeyOut` function to convert the key to a `KeyOutput` struct.

2. What is the purpose of the `printKeyringRecords` function?
- The `printKeyringRecords` function takes a slice of `cryptokeyring.Record` and prints them to the specified output format (`flags.OutputFormatText` or `flags.OutputFormatJSON`) using the `MkAccKeysOutput` function to convert the keys to a slice of `KeyOutput` structs.

3. What is the purpose of the `printTextRecords` function?
- The `printTextRecords` function takes a slice of `KeyOutput` structs and prints them to the output writer in YAML format.
