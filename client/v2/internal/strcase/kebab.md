This file contains a set of functions for converting strings to various case formats. These functions are useful for formatting strings in a consistent way, which can be important for readability and interoperability between different systems.

The functions provided are:

- `ToKebab`: converts a string to kebab-case (e.g. "hello-world")
- `ToScreamingKebab`: converts a string to SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE (e.g. "HELLO-WORLD")
- `ToSnake`: converts a string to snake_case (e.g. "hello_world")
- `ToScreamingSnake`: converts a string to SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g. "HELLO_WORLD")
- `ToDelimited`: converts a string to a custom delimited format (e.g. "hello.world")

Each function takes a string as input and returns a new string in the desired case format. The `ToDelimited` function is the most flexible, allowing the caller to specify the delimiter character to use.

The implementation of these functions is based on a set of rules for converting between different case formats. For example, converting from snake_case to kebab-case involves replacing underscores with hyphens. The functions handle various edge cases, such as acronyms and numbers, to ensure that the resulting strings are consistent and readable.

Overall, these functions are a useful utility for formatting strings in a consistent way, which can be important for interoperability between different systems. They are likely used throughout the larger cosmos-sdk project to ensure that strings are formatted consistently across different modules and components. Here is an example usage of the `ToSnake` function:

```go
import "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/strcase"

func main() {
    input := "HelloWorld"
    output := strcase.ToSnake(input)
    fmt.Println(output) // prints "hello_world"
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code provides functions to convert a string to various cases such as kebab-case, snake_case, and SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.

2. What is the purpose of the `ToDelimited` function?
- The `ToDelimited` function is a helper function used by the other case conversion functions to convert a string to a specified delimited case.

3. How are acronyms treated in the case conversion functions?
- Acronyms are treated as whole words in the case conversion functions, meaning that they are not split into separate words based on capitalization. For example, "JSONData" would be converted to "json_data" in snake_case.
