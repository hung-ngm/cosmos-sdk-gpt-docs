The `autocli` package provides functionality for automatically generating command-line interfaces (CLIs) for protobuf messages in the `cosmos-sdk` project. This file contains three functions: `findSubCommand`, `topLevelCmd`, and `protoNameToCliName`.

The `findSubCommand` function takes a `*cobra.Command` and a `subCmdName` string as input, and returns a sub-command of the provided command whose `Use` string is or begins with the provided `subCmdName`. This function is used to find sub-commands of a top-level command in order to add them as children to the top-level command. For example, if a top-level command has sub-commands `foo` and `bar`, `findSubCommand(topCmd, "foo")` would return the `foo` sub-command.

The `topLevelCmd` function creates a new top-level command with the provided `use` and `short` strings as the command name and description, respectively. The command has `DisableFlagParsing` set to `false` and `SuggestionsMinimumDistance` set to `2`. The `RunE` field is set to `validateCmd`, which is not defined in this file. This function is used to create top-level commands for protobuf messages.

The `protoNameToCliName` function takes a `protoreflect.Name` as input and returns a string in kebab-case. This function is used to convert protobuf message names to CLI command names. For example, if the protobuf message name is `MyMessage`, `protoNameToCliName("MyMessage")` would return `"my-message"`.

Overall, these functions provide utility for generating CLIs for protobuf messages in the `cosmos-sdk` project. They are used in other parts of the project to automatically generate CLIs for various commands and sub-commands.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `findSubCommand` function?
- The `findSubCommand` function is used to search for a sub-command of a given command based on its name or prefix.

2. What does the `topLevelCmd` function do?
- The `topLevelCmd` function creates a new top-level command with the provided name and description, and sets some default properties such as `DisableFlagParsing` and `SuggestionsMinimumDistance`.

3. What is the `protoNameToCliName` function used for?
- The `protoNameToCliName` function is used to convert a protobuf name to a kebab-case string, which is commonly used in CLI commands and flags.
