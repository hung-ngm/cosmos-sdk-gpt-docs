The `autocli` package provides a set of functions for building command-line interfaces (CLIs) for Cosmos SDK applications. This package contains functions for building query commands for all the provided modules, adding sub-commands to the provided command for each method in the specified service, and creating a gRPC query command for the given service method.

The `BuildQueryCommand` function builds the query commands for all the provided modules. If a custom command is provided for a module, this is used instead of any automatically generated CLI commands. This allows apps to have a fully dynamic client with a more customized experience if a binary with custom commands is downloaded. The function takes in a map of module options and a map of custom commands, and returns a `cobra.Command` and an error.

The `AddQueryServiceCommands` function adds a sub-command to the provided command for each method in the specified service and returns the command. This can be used in order to add auto-generated commands to an existing command. The function takes in a `cobra.Command` and a `ServiceCommandDescriptor`, and returns an error.

The `BuildQueryMethodCommand` function creates a gRPC query command for the given service method. This can be used to auto-generate just a single command for a single service rpc method. The function takes in a `protoreflect.MethodDescriptor` and an `RpcCommandOptions`, and returns a `cobra.Command` and an error.

Overall, this package provides a set of functions that can be used to build CLIs for Cosmos SDK applications. These functions can be used to generate commands for querying data from the application, and can be customized to fit the specific needs of the application.
