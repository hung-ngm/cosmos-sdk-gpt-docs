The `autocli` package provides functionality for automatically generating command-line interfaces (CLIs) for gRPC services. This code defines two methods: `BuildMsgCommand` and `AddMsgServiceCommands`. 

`BuildMsgCommand` is a method that builds the message commands for all the provided modules. It takes in two arguments: `moduleOptions`, which is a map of module names to their respective options, and `customCmds`, which is a map of module names to their respective custom commands. It returns a `cobra.Command` object and an error. 

The method first creates a top-level command called `msgCmd` with the name "tx" and the description "Transaction subcommands". It then defines a function called `enhanceMsg` that takes in a command, a module option, and a module name. This function checks if the module has a transaction command descriptor and, if so, creates a sub-command for the module with the name of the module and a description that includes the module name. It then calls `AddMsgServiceCommands` to add the auto-generated commands to the sub-command. Finally, it adds the sub-command to the main `msgCmd` command. 

`AddMsgServiceCommands` is a method that adds a sub-command to the provided command for each method in the specified service and returns the command. It takes in two arguments: `cmd`, which is the command to which the sub-commands will be added, and `cmdDescriptor`, which is a descriptor for the service command. It returns an error. 

The method first iterates over the sub-commands in the `cmdDescriptor` and recursively calls itself to add the sub-commands to the provided command. It then checks if the `cmdDescriptor` has a service name and returns `nil` if it does not. It then uses the `protoregistry` package to find the service descriptor for the specified service name. It then iterates over the methods in the service descriptor and builds a command for each method using the `BuildMsgMethodCommand` method. If the `Skip` option is set to true for a method, it is skipped. Finally, it adds the command to the provided command. 

`BuildMsgMethodCommand` is a method that builds a command for a specified method descriptor and returns the command. It takes in two arguments: `descriptor`, which is the method descriptor, and `options`, which is a descriptor for the RPC command options. It returns a `cobra.Command` object and an error. 

The method first creates a `jsonMarshalOptions` object that is used to marshal the input message to JSON. It then calls a common method called `buildMethodCommandCommon` to build the command. This method takes in the same arguments as `BuildMsgMethodCommand` and a function that is called when the command is executed. This function marshals the input message to JSON and writes it to the output. Finally, it adds transaction connection flags to the command if they are defined. 

Overall, these methods are used to automatically generate CLIs for gRPC services. The `BuildMsgCommand` method builds the top-level command and calls `AddMsgServiceCommands` to add the auto-generated commands. The `AddMsgServiceCommands` method iterates over the methods in the service descriptor and calls `BuildMsgMethodCommand` to build a command for each method. The `BuildMsgMethodCommand` method builds a command for a specified method descriptor and marshals the input message to JSON.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BuildMsgCommand` function?
- The `BuildMsgCommand` function builds the message commands for all the provided modules and returns a `cobra.Command` object. It allows for customization of the client experience by providing custom commands for each module.

2. What does the `AddMsgServiceCommands` function do?
- The `AddMsgServiceCommands` function adds a sub-command to the provided command for each method in the specified service and returns the command. It can be used to add auto-generated commands to an existing command.

3. What is the purpose of the `BuildMsgMethodCommand` function?
- The `BuildMsgMethodCommand` function builds a `cobra.Command` object for a given method descriptor and options. It marshals the input message to JSON and formats the output to either the specified output or standard output.
