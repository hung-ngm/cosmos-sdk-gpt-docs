The `autocli` package provides a command-line interface (CLI) for Cosmos SDK applications. The `AppOptions` struct defines the options for the CLI, including the `Modules` and `ModuleOptions`. The `RootCmd` method generates a root command for the app based on the `AppOptions`. The `EnhanceRootCommand` method enhances the provided root command with the `autocli` `AppOptions`, adding missing query commands and not overriding commands already in the root command. This allows for the graceful integration of `autocli` with existing app CLI commands where `autocli` simply automatically adds things that weren't manually provided. 

The `EnhanceRootCommandWithBuilder` method enhances the provided root command with the `autocli` `AppOptions` using a `Builder`. The `Builder` struct has two fields: `GetClientConn` and `AddQueryConnFlags`. The `GetClientConn` function returns a `grpc.ClientConnInterface` for the query context of the command. The `AddQueryConnFlags` function adds query flags to the command. The `EnhanceRootCommandWithBuilder` method also extracts custom query and message commands from the `Modules` and adds them to the root command. 

Overall, this code provides a way to generate a CLI for Cosmos SDK applications using `autocli`. It allows for the integration of `autocli` with existing app CLI commands and provides a way to extract custom query and message commands from the `Modules`. 

Example usage:

```
var autoCliOpts autocli.AppOptions
err := depinject.Inject(appConfig, &autoCliOpts)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
rootCmd := initRootCmd()
err = autoCliOpts.EnhanceRootCommand(rootCmd)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `cosmos-sdk` project and how does this file fit into the project?
- The `cosmos-sdk` project is not described in this file, so a smart developer might need to look at other documentation or code to understand the project's purpose. This file is located within the project and appears to be related to generating CLI commands for an app.

2. What is the `AppOptions` struct and how is it used?
- The `AppOptions` struct contains options for an app, including modules and module options. It is used to generate a root command for the app and to enhance an existing root command with additional query and transaction commands.

3. What is the purpose of the `EnhanceRootCommand` method and how does it work?
- The `EnhanceRootCommand` method enhances an existing root command with additional query and transaction commands based on the app's `AppOptions`. It uses a `Builder` struct to add the commands and takes into account custom query and transaction commands provided by modules.
