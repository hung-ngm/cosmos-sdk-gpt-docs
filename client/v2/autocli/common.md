The `autocli` package provides functionality for automatically generating CLI commands for gRPC services. This code defines several methods that are used to build and enhance CLI commands for gRPC methods.

The `buildMethodCommandCommon` method takes a gRPC method descriptor, an `RpcCommandOptions` object, and an execution function as input. It then generates a Cobra command that can be used to execute the gRPC method. The generated command includes flags for all of the input message fields, and the `exec` function is called with the input message when the command is executed.

The `enhanceCommandCommon` method takes an existing Cobra command, a map of module options, a map of custom commands, and a function for building module commands as input. It then adds generated or custom commands for each module to the existing command. If a custom command already exists for a module, it is added to the command. If not, a generated command is added based on the module options.

The `outOrStdoutFormat` method takes a Cobra command and a byte slice as input. It formats the byte slice based on the output flag of the command and writes the formatted output to the command's output stream.

These methods are used to generate and enhance CLI commands for gRPC methods in the larger project. The `buildMethodCommandCommon` method is used to generate commands for individual gRPC methods, while the `enhanceCommandCommon` method is used to generate commands for entire modules. The `outOrStdoutFormat` method is used to format and output the results of these commands. Overall, these methods provide a convenient way to interact with gRPC services using a CLI interface.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `buildMethodCommandCommon` function?
- The `buildMethodCommandCommon` function builds a Cobra command for a given method descriptor, with options for the command's use, long description, short description, example, aliases, and more.

2. What is the purpose of the `enhanceCommandCommon` function?
- The `enhanceCommandCommon` function enhances a provided query or message command with either generated commands based on provided module options or custom commands for each module. If the provided query command already contains a command for a module, that command is not overwritten by this method.

3. What is the purpose of the `outOrStdoutFormat` function?
- The `outOrStdoutFormat` function formats the output based on the output flag and writes it to the command's output stream. If the output type is text, the function converts the JSON to YAML.
