The `cmtservice` package contains functions related to the CometBFT consensus algorithm. The `getBlock` function retrieves a block at a given height from the node specified in the `clientCtx` context. It returns a `ResultBlock` struct, which contains information about the block, such as its header, transactions, and evidence.

The `GetProtoBlock` function builds on top of `getBlock` and returns a `BlockID` and `Block` in the `cmtproto` package format. This function is useful for converting a block to a format that can be used by other CometBFT components. 

Both functions take in a `context.Context` and a `client.Context` as parameters. The `context.Context` is used to manage the lifecycle of the request, while the `client.Context` contains information about the client, such as the node URL and the client's account information.

Here is an example of how `GetProtoBlock` can be used:

```
import (
    "context"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/client"
    "github.com/cometbft/cometbft/proto/tendermint/types"
    "github.com/cometbft/cometbft/rpc/core/types"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    clientCtx := client.Context{} // fill in client context information

    height := int64(10)
    blockID, block, err := GetProtoBlock(ctx, clientCtx, &height)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }

    // use blockID and block
}
```

In summary, the `cmtservice` package provides functions for retrieving and converting blocks in the CometBFT consensus algorithm. These functions are used by other CometBFT components to interact with the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines functions for retrieving a block from a Cosmos SDK node and converting it to a Tendermint block format.
2. What are the input parameters for the `GetProtoBlock` function?
   - The `GetProtoBlock` function takes in a context, a client context, and a pointer to an int64 height.
3. What external packages are being imported and used in this code?
   - This code imports and uses packages from `github.com/cometbft/cometbft/proto/tendermint/types`, `github.com/cometbft/cometbft/rpc/core/types`, and `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/client`.
