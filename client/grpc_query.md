The `client` package contains the implementation of the `Context` struct, which is used to interact with the Cosmos SDK client. The `Context` struct implements the `gogogrpc.ClientConn` interface, which is used to make gRPC calls to the Cosmos SDK server.

The `Invoke` method is used to invoke a gRPC method on the server. It first checks if the request is a broadcast transaction request. If it is, it calls the `TxServiceBroadcast` method to broadcast the transaction. If not, it checks if the gRPC client is set. If it is, it invokes the gRPC method using the client. If not, it queries the state using the ABCI query. It then creates header metadata and parses all the call options. If the call option is a `HeaderCallOption`, it sets the value of that header to the metadata. Finally, it unpacks the interfaces if the interface registry is set.

The `NewStream` method is not supported and returns an error.

The `gRPCCodec` method checks if the `Context`'s codec is `codec.GRPCCodecProvider`. If it is, it returns the gRPC codec. If not, it returns the fallback codec.

Overall, the `Context` struct is a crucial part of the Cosmos SDK client that allows users to interact with the Cosmos SDK server using gRPC calls. It provides a simple and efficient way to query the state and broadcast transactions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of the Invoke and NewStream methods for the Context struct, which is used for gRPC client connections in the cosmos-sdk project.

2. What is the fallback codec used in this code file?
- The fallback codec used in this code file is a ProtoCodec created using the NewProtoCodec function from the codec package, which can process every gRPC type except the ones that contain interfaces in their types.

3. What happens if the request argument is nil in the Invoke method?
- If the request argument is nil in the Invoke method, it will return an error wrapped with the ErrInvalidRequest error from the sdkerrors package, indicating that the request cannot be nil.
