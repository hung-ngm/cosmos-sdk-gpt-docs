The `pruning` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code that is responsible for pruning the history of the application state. The `Cmd` function in this package is a Cobra command that can be executed from the command line to prune the application state history. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to manage the size of the application state history by deleting old heights. The pruning options are provided via the `--pruning` flag or alternatively with `--pruning-keep-recent`. The available pruning options are `default`, `nothing`, `everything`, and `custom`. The `default` option keeps the last 362880 states, `nothing` saves all historic states, `everything` keeps only the 2 latest states, and `custom` allows pruning options to be manually specified through `pruning-keep-recent`. 

The `Cmd` function takes an `appCreator` function as an argument, which is used to create the application. The function then binds the flags to the context's Viper so that pruning options can be obtained. It then opens the database using the `openDB` function, which takes the database home directory and database backend type as arguments. The `appCreator` function is then called to create the application, and the `CommitMultiStore` function is used to get the root multi-store. The latest height is obtained using the `GetLatestVersion` function, and the valid heights are checked to ensure that they are greater than 0. 

The function then creates a list of pruning heights based on the pruning options. If there are no heights to prune, the function returns. Otherwise, the `PruneStores` function is called to prune the application root multi-stores. If the pruning is successful, the function returns a success message. 

Here is an example of how to use the `prune` command:

```
prune --home './' --app-db-backend 'goleveldb' --pruning 'custom' --pruning-keep-recent 100
```

This command prunes the application state history by keeping the most recent 100 heights and deleting the old heights. The database home directory is set to the current directory, and the database backend type is set to `goleveldb`.
