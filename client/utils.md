The `client` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains functions and utilities for interacting with a CometBFT node over JSON RPC and WebSockets. This file contains several functions related to pagination and flag parsing.

The `Paginate` function takes in the total number of objects, the desired page number, the number of objects per page, and a default limit. It returns the starting and ending indices for the requested page. If the requested page is invalid or the limit is non-positive, it returns -1 for both indices. This function is useful for paginating queries to the CometBFT node.

The `ReadPageRequest` function reads and builds the necessary page request flags for pagination. It takes in a `pflag.FlagSet` and returns a `query.PageRequest` and an error. This function is used to parse pagination flags from the command line and create a `query.PageRequest` object that can be used to make a paginated query to the CometBFT node.

The `NewClientFromNode` function sets up a `Client` implementation that communicates with a CometBFT node over JSON RPC and WebSockets. It takes in a node URI and returns an `rpchttp.HTTP` object and an error. This function is used to create a client that can be used to interact with the CometBFT node.

The `FlagSetWithPageKeyDecoded` function returns the provided `pflag.FlagSet` with the page-key value base64 decoded (if it exists). This is useful when the page-key is provided as a base64 string from the command line, but the `ReadPageRequest` function expects it to be the raw bytes.

The `MustFlagSetWithPageKeyDecoded` function calls `FlagSetWithPageKeyDecoded` and panics on error. This function is useful when parsing flags from the command line and the page-key is expected to be provided as a base64 string.

Overall, this file contains several utility functions that are used to parse pagination flags and create a client that can be used to interact with a CometBFT node. These functions are used in other parts of the `cosmos-sdk` project to make paginated queries and interact with the CometBFT node.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Paginate` function?
- The `Paginate` function returns the starting and ending index for a paginated query based on the desired page and limit of objects and the total number of objects provided by the handler.

2. What is the purpose of the `ReadPageRequest` function?
- The `ReadPageRequest` function reads and builds the necessary page request flags for pagination.

3. What is the purpose of the `NewClientFromNode` function?
- The `NewClientFromNode` function sets up a client implementation that communicates with a CometBFT node over JSON RPC and WebSockets.
