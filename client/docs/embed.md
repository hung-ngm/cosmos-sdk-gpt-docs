This code is responsible for embedding the Swagger UI into the cosmos-sdk project. Swagger UI is a tool for visualizing and interacting with APIs. The `embed` package is used to embed the Swagger UI files into the project, making them easily accessible to users. 

The `//go:embed` directive is used to specify the directory containing the Swagger UI files. This directive tells the Go compiler to include the specified files in the binary when it is built. The `embed.FS` type is used to represent the embedded file system. 

This code is important for the cosmos-sdk project because it allows users to easily interact with the project's APIs. By embedding the Swagger UI files, users can access the documentation and test the APIs without having to leave the project's environment. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/docs"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()

    // Serve the Swagger UI at /docs
    r.StaticFS("/docs", docs.SwaggerUI)

    // ... other routes ...

    r.Run(":8080")
}
```

In this example, the Swagger UI is served at the `/docs` endpoint using the `StaticFS` method from the `gin` framework. This allows users to access the Swagger UI by visiting `http://localhost:8080/docs` in their web browser.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `embed` package being imported?
   - The `embed` package is being used to embed the `swagger-ui` directory into the binary.

2. What is the `SwaggerUI` variable and what type is it?
   - The `SwaggerUI` variable is a variable that holds the embedded `swagger-ui` directory, and its type is `embed.FS`.

3. What is the significance of the `//go:embed` directive?
   - The `//go:embed` directive is a new feature in Go 1.16 that allows embedding of files and directories into the binary at compile time.
