This file contains the implementation of the `Context` struct and associated methods for the Cosmos SDK project. The `Context` struct is used to store information about the current state of the blockchain, such as the current height and the client used to interact with the network. The methods defined in this file provide functionality for querying the blockchain and retrieving information from the `Context`.

The `GetNode` method returns an RPC client for interacting with the CometBFT node. If the client is not defined in offline mode, an error is returned. The `Query` method performs a query to a CometBFT node with the provided path and returns the result and height of the query upon success or an error if the query fails. The `QueryWithData` method is similar to `Query`, but also takes a data payload. The `QueryStore` method performs a query to a CometBFT node with the provided key and store name. The `QueryABCI` method performs a query to a CometBFT node with the provided `RequestQuery` and returns the `ResultQuery` obtained from the query.

The `GetFromAddress`, `GetFeePayerAddress`, and `GetFeeGranterAddress` methods return the from address, fee payer address, and fee granter address, respectively, from the `Context`. The `GetFromName` method returns the key name for the current context.

The `queryABCI` method performs a query to a CometBFT node with the provided `RequestQuery`. The height used to perform the query is the `RequestQuery` height if it is non-zero, otherwise the context height is used. The `sdkErrorToGRPCError` method converts an `abci.ResponseQuery` to a gRPC error. The `query` method performs a query to a CometBFT node with the provided store name and path. The `queryStore` method is similar to `query`, but also takes an end path. The `isQueryStoreWithProof` method expects a format like `/<queryType>/<storeName>/<subpath>`, where `queryType` must be "store" and `subpath` must be "key" to require a proof.

Overall, this file provides a set of methods for querying the blockchain and retrieving information from the `Context`. These methods are used throughout the Cosmos SDK project to interact with the network and retrieve information about the current state of the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Context` struct and how is it used in this code?
- The `Context` struct is used to perform queries to a CometBFT node and contains information such as the RPC client, height, and addresses. It is used to call functions that perform queries and return results or errors.

2. What is the significance of the `queryStore` function and how is it different from `query`?
- The `queryStore` function performs a query to a specific store name and end path, while `query` performs a query to a provided path. `queryStore` is used to query a specific store, while `query` is used for more general queries.

3. What is the purpose of the `isQueryStoreWithProof` function and when is it used?
- The `isQueryStoreWithProof` function checks if a query to a store requires a proof. It is used to determine whether or not to verify the data returned from a query.
