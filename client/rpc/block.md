The `rpc` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains functions for interacting with the CometBFT RPC. The `GetChainHeight` function returns the current height of the blockchain. It takes a `client.Context` object as input and returns an integer height and an error.

The `QueryBlocks` function searches for blocks based on `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock` events via the CometBFT RPC. It takes a `client.Context` object, page number, limit, query, and orderBy as input. The `query` parameter is a string that specifies the events to search for. The function returns a `SearchBlocksResult` object and an error.

The `GetBlockByHeight` function retrieves a block by its height. It takes a `client.Context` object and a pointer to an integer height as input and returns a `Block` object and an error.

The `GetBlockByHash` function retrieves a block by its hash. It takes a `client.Context` object and a string hashHexString as input and returns a `Block` object and an error.

The `formatBlockResults` function parses indexed blocks into a slice of `BlockResponse` objects. It takes a slice of `ResultBlock` objects as input and returns a slice of `Block` objects and an error.

These functions can be used to interact with the CometBFT RPC and retrieve information about the blockchain. For example, `GetChainHeight` can be used to get the current height of the blockchain, while `QueryBlocks` can be used to search for blocks based on specific events. `GetBlockByHeight` and `GetBlockByHash` can be used to retrieve blocks by their height or hash, respectively. The `formatBlockResults` function can be used to parse indexed blocks into a more usable format.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `GetChainHeight` function do?
- The `GetChainHeight` function returns the current blockchain height by querying the node's status.

2. What is the purpose of the `QueryBlocks` function?
- The `QueryBlocks` function performs a search for blocks based on BeginBlock and EndBlock events via the CometBFT RPC. It takes a custom query as input and returns a `SearchBlocksResult` object.

3. What does the `formatBlockResults` function do?
- The `formatBlockResults` function parses the indexed blocks into a slice of `BlockResponse` objects. It takes a slice of `ResultBlock` objects as input and returns a slice of `Block` objects.
