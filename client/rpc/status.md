The `rpc` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to remote procedure calls (RPC) for interacting with a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain network. This particular file defines a `StatusCommand` function that returns a Cobra command for querying the status of a remote node on the network. 

The `StatusCommand` function takes no arguments and returns a `cobra.Command` object. When executed, the command sends a request to a remote node specified by the `--node` flag (defaulting to `tcp://localhost:26657`) to get its status. The status includes information about the node's synchronization status, validator information, and other metadata. 

The `getNodeStatus` function is called by `StatusCommand` to retrieve the status of the remote node. It takes a `client.Context` object as an argument, which is used to get a handle to the remote node. The function returns a `coretypes.ResultStatus` object, which contains the status information for the node.

The `validatorInfo` and `resultStatus` structs define the format of the validator and node status information, respectively. They are used to convert the Tendermint public keys in the status response to the corresponding CometBFT public keys. 

The `StatusCommand` function marshals the `resultStatus` object into JSON format and prints it to the console. This command can be used by developers and users to check the status of a remote node on the network, which is useful for monitoring the health of the network and diagnosing issues. 

Example usage:
```
$ cosmos-sdk rpc status --node tcp://myremotehost:26657
{"NodeInfo":{"protocol_version":{"p2p":"7","block":"10","app":"0"},"id":"f8d9c9e7d3c3e3f7c8c3d3f7c8c9e7d3","listen_addr":"tcp://0.0.0.0:26656","network":"testnet","version":"0.33.0","channels":"4020212223303800"},"SyncInfo":{"latest_block_hash":"E1F1F7C2B9E9E7C1E9E7C1E9E7C1E9E7C1E9E7C1E9E7C1E9E7C1E9E7C1E9E7C1","latest_app_hash":"00000000000000000000000000000000","latest_block_height":"1000","latest_block_time":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000000000Z","catching_up":false},"ValidatorInfo":{"Address":"E1F1F7C2B9E9E7C1E9E7C1E9E7C1E9E7C1E9E7C1","PubKey":{"type":"tendermint/PubKeyEd25519","value":"u7J1Jz5tJz5tJz5tJz5tJz5tJz5tJz5tJz5tJz5tJw="},"VotingPower":100}}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `StatusCommand` function do?
- `StatusCommand` returns a `cobra.Command` that queries a remote node for its status.

2. What is the purpose of the `validatorInfo` and `resultStatus` structs?
- `validatorInfo` is used to store information about the node's validator, including its address, public key, and voting power. `resultStatus` is used to store the node's status information, including its `NodeInfo`, `SyncInfo`, and `ValidatorInfo`.

3. What is the purpose of the `getNodeStatus` function?
- `getNodeStatus` takes a `client.Context` and returns the status of the node associated with that context.
