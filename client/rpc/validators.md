The `rpc` package contains functions and types related to the CometBFT RPC interface. The `ValidatorCommand` function returns a Cobra command that retrieves the full CometBFT validator set at a given height. The function takes an optional height argument and returns a list of validators, including their address, public key, proposer priority, and voting power. The `GetValidators` function is called by `ValidatorCommand` to retrieve the validators from the CometBFT node. It takes a context, client context, height, page, and limit as arguments and returns a `ResultValidatorsOutput` struct containing the block height, validators, and total count. The `ResultValidatorsOutput` struct contains a `ValidatorOutput` struct that defines the output format for each validator. The `validatorOutput` function converts a `cmttypes.Validator` to a `ValidatorOutput`. 

This code is used to retrieve the validator set for a given height in the CometBFT network. It can be used by developers building applications on top of the Cosmos SDK to query the state of the CometBFT network. For example, a developer building a block explorer for the CometBFT network could use this code to display the current validator set and their voting power. 

Example usage:

```
$ cosmos-sdk comet-validator-set 1000
```

This command retrieves the validator set at height 1000 and returns a list of validators in the specified output format.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `ValidatorCommand` function do?
- The `ValidatorCommand` function returns a Cobra command that retrieves the full CometBFT validator set at a given height.

2. What is the purpose of the `ResultValidatorsOutput` struct?
- The `ResultValidatorsOutput` struct represents the output of the `GetValidators` function, which retrieves the validators at a certain height in bech32 format.

3. What is the significance of the `validatorOutput` function?
- The `validatorOutput` function converts a `cmttypes.Validator` object to a `ValidatorOutput` object, which is used to populate the `Validators` field of the `ResultValidatorsOutput` struct.
