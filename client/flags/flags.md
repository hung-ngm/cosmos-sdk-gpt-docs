The `flags` package provides a set of common flags and flag-related functions that can be used across the Cosmos SDK. The package defines a set of constants that represent default values for gas adjustment, gas limit, and keyring backend. It also defines a set of CLI flags that can be used to configure various aspects of the Cosmos SDK, such as the home directory, keyring directory, chain ID, node address, gRPC endpoint, gas adjustment, gas limit, and broadcast mode.

The package provides functions to add common flags to a module query or transaction command. For example, `AddQueryFlagsToCmd` adds common flags to a module query command, such as the node address, gRPC endpoint, height, and output format. Similarly, `AddTxFlagsToCmd` adds common flags to a module transaction command, such as the output format, gas limit, gas adjustment, fees, gas prices, node address, broadcast mode, and keyring backend.

The package also provides a `GasSetting` struct that encapsulates the possible values passed through the `--gas` flag. The `ParseGasSetting` function parses a string gas value and returns a `GasSetting` struct. The value may either be `auto`, which indicates a transaction should be executed in simulate mode to automatically find a sufficient gas value, or a string integer. The `GasSetting` struct has a `Simulate` field that indicates whether the transaction should be executed in simulate mode, and a `Gas` field that represents the gas limit.

Overall, the `flags` package provides a set of common flags and flag-related functions that can be used across the Cosmos SDK to configure various aspects of the SDK. It provides a convenient way to add common flags to a module query or transaction command and parse gas values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this package and what other packages does it import?
- This package is called `flags` and it is part of the `cosmos-sdk` project. It imports packages such as `cobra`, `pflag`, and `keyring` from external libraries.
2. What are some of the CLI flags that can be used with this package and what do they do?
- Some of the CLI flags that can be used with this package include `--gas`, `--from`, `--fees`, `--broadcast-mode`, and `--output`. These flags are used to set the gas limit for a transaction, specify the sender of a transaction, set the fees to be paid for a transaction, choose the broadcasting mode for a transaction, and set the output format for a command, respectively.
3. What is the purpose of the `GasSetting` struct and how is it used?
- The `GasSetting` struct is used to encapsulate the possible values passed through the `--gas` flag. It has two fields: `Simulate` and `Gas`. It is used to determine whether a transaction should be executed in simulate mode to automatically find a sufficient gas value or whether a specific gas value should be used for a transaction. It is returned by the `ParseGasSetting` function, which parses a string gas value provided through the `--gas` flag.
