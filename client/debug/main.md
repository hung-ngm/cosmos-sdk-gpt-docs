The `debug` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides a set of tools for debugging applications built on the Cosmos SDK. This particular file contains code for a CLI command that can be used to decode and manipulate public keys, addresses, and raw bytes.

The `Cmd()` function creates the main CLI command for the `debug` package. It adds subcommands for decoding public keys (`PubkeyCmd()`), decoding raw public keys in various formats (`PubkeyRawCmd()`), converting addresses between hex and bech32 formats (`AddrCmd()`), converting raw bytes to hex format (`RawBytesCmd()`), and listing the prefixes used for Human-Readable Part (HRP) in Bech32 addresses (`PrefixesCmd()`).

The `PubkeyCmd()` function takes a single argument, a JSON-encoded public key, and decodes it to display the key's address and hex representation. The `PubkeyRawCmd()` function takes a single argument, a raw public key in hex, base64, or bech32 format, and decodes it to display the key's address, JSON representation, and bech32-encoded versions for account, validator operator, and consensus keys. The `AddrCmd()` function takes a single argument, an address in hex or bech32 format, and converts it to display the address in both formats. The `RawBytesCmd()` function takes a single argument, a list of raw bytes in square brackets, and converts it to display the bytes in hex format. The `PrefixesCmd()` function displays the prefixes used for HRP in Bech32 addresses.

Overall, this code provides a set of useful debugging tools for developers building applications on the Cosmos SDK. For example, the `PubkeyRawCmd()` command can be used to decode raw public keys obtained from external sources, while the `AddrCmd()` command can be used to convert addresses between different formats.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `debug` package in `cosmos-sdk`?
- The `debug` package provides a set of CLI commands for debugging applications built on the Cosmos SDK.

2. What types of public keys can be decoded using the `PubkeyRawCmd` command?
- The `PubkeyRawCmd` command can decode ED25519 or secp256k1 public keys from hex, base64, or bech32.

3. What is the purpose of the `RawBytesCmd` command?
- The `RawBytesCmd` command converts raw bytes output (e.g. `[10 21 13 255]`) to hex.
