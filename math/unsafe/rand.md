The `unsafe` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains a `Rand` struct that is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) seeded with OS randomness. The `Rand` struct uses `crypto/rand` to obtain OS randomness, but none of the provided methods are suitable for cryptographic usage. Instead, they all utilize `math/rand`'s PRNG internally. The `Rand` struct is designed to be used concurrently, and this is achieved by using a mutex lock on all of the provided methods.

The `Rand` struct has several methods that can be used to generate random numbers and strings. The `Seed` method seeds the PRNG with a given integer value. The `Str` method constructs a random alphanumeric string of a given length. The `Int63` method returns a random 63-bit integer, and the `Int` method returns a random integer. The `Bytes` method returns a slice of random bytes generated from the internal PRNG.

The `unsafe` package also contains global functions that can be used to generate random numbers and strings without creating a new `Rand` struct. The `Seed` function seeds the global `Rand` struct with a given integer value. The `Str` function constructs a random alphanumeric string of a given length. The `Int63` function returns a random 63-bit integer, and the `Int` function returns a random integer. The `Bytes` function returns a slice of random bytes generated from the internal PRNG.

Overall, the `Rand` struct and global functions in the `unsafe` package provide a convenient way to generate random numbers and strings in a concurrent-safe manner. These functions can be used throughout the `cosmos-sdk` project to generate random values for testing, simulations, and other purposes. For example, the `Str` function could be used to generate random account addresses or transaction IDs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `unsafe` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- It is unclear from this code snippet what the purpose of the `unsafe` package is, as this file only contains code related to generating random numbers.

2. What is the purpose of the `Rand` struct and its associated methods?
- The `Rand` struct is a pseudorandom number generator that is seeded with OS randomness. Its methods provide functionality for generating random numbers, bytes, and alphanumeric strings of a given length.

3. Why is a mutex lock used in the `Rand` struct's methods?
- The mutex lock is used to ensure that the `Rand` struct's methods can be safely used concurrently by multiple goroutines.
