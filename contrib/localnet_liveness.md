This script is a bash script that is used to test the stability of a blockchain network. It takes in four arguments: the number of iterations to run, the number of seconds to sleep between iterations, the block height to declare completion, and the node address to poll. 

The script first checks if all four arguments are provided, and if not, it exits with an error message. It then retrieves the list of docker containers running the blockchain network and stores them in an array. 

The script then enters a loop that runs for the number of iterations specified. Within each iteration, it retrieves the current block height of the blockchain network by making an HTTP GET request to the node address provided and parsing the response using the jq command-line JSON processor. If the current block height is not empty, it prints the number of blocks to the console. 

The script then checks if the current block height is greater than the number of blocks specified. If it is, it prints a success message and exits with a status code of 0. 

Every 10 iterations, the script randomly selects a container from the list of containers and restarts it to emulate network chaos. This is done by using the docker restart command. 

After each iteration, the script sleeps for the number of seconds specified before starting the next iteration. 

If the script completes all iterations without reaching the specified number of blocks, it prints a failure message and exits with a status code of 1. 

This script can be used as a tool to test the stability of a blockchain network by running it against a test network and observing the output. It can help identify potential issues with the network, such as slow block times or network instability. The script can also be modified to include additional tests or checks to further evaluate the network's stability. 

Example usage of the script: 

```
./test_network.sh 100 5 1000 http://localhost:26657
```

This will run the script for 100 iterations, sleeping for 5 seconds between each iteration, and declaring completion when the network reaches a block height of 1000. The script will poll the node at http://localhost:26657 for block height information.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   - This script is designed to poll a node address for the latest block height and restart a random docker container every 10 blocks until a specified number of blocks is reached or a timeout is reached.
2. What are the required inputs for this script?
   - The required inputs for this script are the number of iterations to run, the number of seconds to sleep between iterations, the block height to declare completion, and the node address to poll.
3. What is the significance of restarting a random docker container every 10 blocks?
   - Restarting a random docker container every 10 blocks is used to emulate network chaos and test the resilience of the system.
