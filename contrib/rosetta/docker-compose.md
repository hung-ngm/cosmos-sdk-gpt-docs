This code is a docker-compose file that defines and configures four services for the cosmos-sdk project: cosmos, rosetta, faucet, and test_rosetta.

The `cosmos` service is an instance of the `rosetta-ci` image that runs the `simd` command with various options. `simd` is a binary that runs a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain node. The `--pruning` option specifies the pruning mode for the node, which is set to "nothing" to keep all historical data. The `--grpc.enable` and `--grpc.address` options enable and specify the gRPC server address, respectively. The `--grpc-web.enable` option enables the gRPC-Web protocol, which allows web clients to communicate with the gRPC server. The `ports` section maps the container's ports 9090 and 26657 to the host's ports 9090 and 26657, respectively. The `logging` section disables logging for this service.

The `rosetta` service is another instance of the `rosetta-ci` image that depends on the `cosmos` service. It runs the `simd rosetta` command with various options. The `--blockchain` and `--network` options specify the blockchain and network identifiers, respectively. The `--tendermint` and `--grpc` options specify the Tendermint RPC and gRPC server addresses, respectively. The `--addr` option specifies the HTTP server address. The `ports` section maps the container's port 8080 to the host's port 8080.

The `faucet` service is another instance of the `rosetta-ci` image that sets the working directory to `/rosetta` and runs the `python3 faucet.py` command. This service exposes the container's port 8080.

The `test_rosetta` service is another instance of the `rosetta-ci` image that depends on the `cosmos`, `rosetta`, and `faucet` services. It mounts the `./configuration` directory to `/rosetta/config` in the container and runs the `./config/run_tests.sh` command. This service sets the working directory to `/rosetta`.

Overall, this docker-compose file defines a local development environment for the cosmos-sdk project that includes a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain node, a Rosetta API server, a faucet service for dispensing test tokens, and a test runner for the Rosetta API implementation. Developers can use this environment to test and debug their code changes before deploying them to a production environment.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a docker-compose file that defines and configures several services (cosmos, rosetta, faucet, and test_rosetta) for a project called cosmos-sdk. It sets up containers with specific images, commands, ports, and volumes to run different components of the project.

2. What dependencies are required to run this code?
- To run this code, you need to have Docker and docker-compose installed on your system. You also need to have the rosetta-ci image available to pull from a registry or build locally.

3. What is the role of each service defined in this file?
- The cosmos service runs a blockchain node with specific settings and exposes ports for gRPC and Tendermint RPC. The rosetta service runs a rosetta gateway that connects to the cosmos node and exposes a RESTful API on port 8080. The faucet service runs a Python script that serves as a faucet for the blockchain. The test_rosetta service runs a test suite for the rosetta gateway with specific configurations and volumes mounted.
