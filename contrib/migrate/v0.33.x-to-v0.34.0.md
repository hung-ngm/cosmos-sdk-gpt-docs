The `process_raw_genesis` function in this file is responsible for processing the raw genesis file of a Cosmos SDK blockchain and updating it with various changes. The purpose of this function is to prepare the genesis file for the launch of a new blockchain or for an upgrade of an existing one. 

The function takes two arguments: `genesis`, which is a dictionary containing the raw genesis file, and `parsed_args`, which is a dictionary containing parsed command-line arguments. The function first updates the `consensus_params` field of the genesis file to remove a deprecated field and add a new field. It then adds a new field to the `app_state` field to set a constant fee for the `crisis` module. The function also migrates the governance state to a new internal structure, updates the `mint` module's parameters, and updates the `consensus_params` field to set new values for gas and block size. Finally, the function enables transfers and sets a new chain ID and genesis start time.

The `migrate_gov_data` function is a helper function that is called by `process_raw_genesis` to migrate the governance state to the new internal structure. This function iterates over the proposals in the governance state and updates their structure to match the new internal structure.

This file is a part of the Cosmos SDK project and is used to prepare the genesis file for the launch of a new blockchain or for an upgrade of an existing one. The `process_raw_genesis` function is called by other scripts in the project to update the genesis file. For example, it may be called by a script that launches a new blockchain or upgrades an existing one. 

Example usage:

```
from process_genesis import process_raw_genesis

# read in the raw genesis file
with open('genesis.json', 'r') as f:
    genesis = json.load(f)

# parse command-line arguments
parsed_args = {
    'chain_id': 'mychain',
    'start_time': '2022-01-01T00:00:00Z'
}

# process the raw genesis file
processed_genesis = process_raw_genesis(genesis, parsed_args)

# write the processed genesis file to disk
with open('processed_genesis.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(processed_genesis, f)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is used to convert genesis.json from v0.33.x to v0.34.0 in the cosmos-sdk project.

2. What changes are being made to the genesis file?

    The code updates the genesis file with breaking changes, migrates governance state, updates proposal parameters, enables transfers, and sets a new chain ID and genesis start time.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `process_raw_genesis` function?

    The `process_raw_genesis` function takes in two arguments: `genesis` and `parsed_args`. `genesis` is a dictionary representing the genesis file, and `parsed_args` is a dictionary containing parsed command-line arguments. The function updates the `genesis` dictionary and returns it.
