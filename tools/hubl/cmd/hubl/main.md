This code is the entry point for the hubl tool, which is a sub-tool of the larger cosmos-sdk project. The purpose of this code is to initialize the hubl tool by calling the `RootCommand()` function from the `internal` package and executing the resulting command.

The `RootCommand()` function likely sets up the command-line interface for the hubl tool, defining the available commands and their associated flags and arguments. This function may also set up any necessary configuration or state for the tool.

The `main()` function then calls `RootCommand()` and checks for any errors. If an error occurs, the program panics and exits. Otherwise, the resulting command is executed using the `Execute()` method.

This code is important because it serves as the entry point for the hubl tool, allowing users to interact with the tool via the command line. It also demonstrates the use of the `internal` package, which likely contains implementation details that are not meant to be exposed to users of the tool.

Example usage of the hubl tool might look like:

```
$ hubl create my-template
Creating new HubL template...
Template created successfully!
```

Overall, this code is a crucial component of the hubl tool and the larger cosmos-sdk project, allowing users to interact with the tool and perform useful actions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `internal` package being imported?
   - The `internal` package is being imported to access the `RootCommand` function from within the `cosmos-sdk` project.

2. What does the `RootCommand` function do?
   - The `RootCommand` function is not shown in this code snippet, but it is being called to retrieve a command for the `cosmos-sdk` project.

3. What happens if an error occurs during execution?
   - If an error occurs during execution, the program will panic and terminate.
