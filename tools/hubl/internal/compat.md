The `loadFileDescriptorsGRPCReflection` function attempts to load the file descriptor set for a given gRPC client connection using gRPC reflection. If the `cosmos.reflection.v1` package is available, it will be used to load the file descriptor set. Otherwise, a fallback method is used, which may not be able to read all data and may not support all features.

The function first attempts to retrieve a list of all interfaces and their implementations using the `reflectionv1beta1` package. It then creates a `ServerReflectionClient` using the `grpc_reflection_v1alpha` package and sends a `ListServices` request to retrieve a list of all available services. It then sends a `FileContainingSymbol` request for each service and interface implementation to retrieve the corresponding file descriptor. The file descriptors are stored in a map, and any missing dependencies are retrieved using the same `ServerReflectionClient` and stored in the map as well.

If any file descriptors cannot be found, a warning is printed to the console. Finally, the file descriptors are returned as a `FileDescriptorSet`.

The `guessAutocli` function attempts to generate a default mapping of services to commands for use with the `autocli` package. It iterates over all files in a given `protoregistry.Files` object and looks for services with names that match the keys in the `defaultAutocliMappings` map. If a match is found, the corresponding value in the map is used to generate a mapping of the service to a command. The resulting mappings are returned as an `AppOptionsResponse`.

Overall, these functions are used to load file descriptors and generate mappings for use with other packages in the `cosmos-sdk` project, such as `autocli`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `loadFileDescriptorsGRPCReflection` function?
- The `loadFileDescriptorsGRPCReflection` function attempts to load the file descriptor set using gRPC reflection when `cosmos.reflection.v1` is unavailable.

2. What is the purpose of the `guessAutocli` function?
- The `guessAutocli` function is used to provide some default mappings to support a subset of the available services when the chain does not support autocli directly yet.

3. What is the purpose of the `missingFileDescriptors` function?
- The `missingFileDescriptors` function is used to identify any file descriptors that have not been loaded yet by looping through all the file descriptor dependencies.
