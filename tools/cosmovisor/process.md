The `cosmovisor` package provides a process manager for Cosmos SDK-based applications. This package contains a `Launcher` struct that is responsible for launching the application in a subprocess and monitoring it for upgrades. The `Launcher` struct has a `Run` method that takes in arguments, `stdout` and `stderr` writers, and returns a boolean value indicating whether an upgrade was detected and the upgrade process started. 

The `WaitForUpgradeOrExit` method checks the upgrade plan file created by the application and returns a boolean value indicating whether an upgrade should be initiated. If an upgrade is detected, the `doBackup` method is called to take a backup of the data directory. If the `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP` environment variable is not set, the `doBackup` method copies the `$DAEMON_HOME/data` directory to a backup directory. The `doPreUpgrade` method runs the pre-upgrade command defined by the application and handles respective error codes. If the pre-upgrade command fails, the method retries the command until it succeeds or reaches the maximum number of retries defined in the configuration. 

The `IsSkipUpgradeHeight` method checks if the pre-upgrade script must be run. If the height in the upgrade plan matches any of the heights provided in `--unsafe-skip-upgrades`, the script is not run. The `UpgradeSkipHeights` method gets all the heights provided when `simd start --unsafe-skip-upgrades <height1> <optional_height_2> ... <optional_height_N>`.

Overall, the `cosmovisor` package provides a robust process manager for Cosmos SDK-based applications that can handle upgrades and backups. The `Launcher` struct provides a simple interface for launching the application and monitoring it for upgrades. The `doPreUpgrade` method ensures that the pre-upgrade command is run before the upgrade process starts. The `doBackup` method takes a backup of the data directory before the upgrade process starts, ensuring that data is not lost during the upgrade process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Launcher` struct and how is it used in the `cosmovisor` project?
- The `Launcher` struct is used to launch the app in a subprocess and monitor it for upgrades. It contains a logger, configuration information, and a file watcher. It is used to run the app and handle upgrades when necessary.

2. What is the purpose of the `WaitForUpgradeOrExit` function and what does it return?
- The `WaitForUpgradeOrExit` function checks the upgrade plan file created by the app and waits for an upgrade request or for the process to exit. It returns a boolean indicating whether an upgrade should be initiated and an error if there was an issue reading the upgrade-info file or the process died by itself.

3. What is the purpose of the `doPreUpgrade` function and how does it handle errors?
- The `doPreUpgrade` function runs the pre-upgrade command defined by the application and handles respective error codes. It retries the command a maximum number of times defined in the configuration until it succeeds or reaches the maximum number of retries. If the command does not exist, it continues the upgrade. If it fails with an exit code of 30, it returns an error. If it fails with an exit code of 31, it retries the command.
