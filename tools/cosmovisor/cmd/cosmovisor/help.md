The code above is a part of the `cosmos-sdk` project and it defines a function called `GetHelpText()`. This function returns a multi-line string that provides information about `Cosmovisor`, which is a process manager for Cosmos SDK application binaries. 

The purpose of `Cosmovisor` is to start a Cosmos SDK based application by passing all provided arguments and monitor the `upgrade-info.json` file located in the `%s/data/` directory to perform an update. The `upgrade-info.json` file is created by the `x/upgrade` module of the application when the blockchain height reaches an approved upgrade proposal. The file includes data from the proposal, which `Cosmovisor` interprets to perform an update by switching to a current binary and restarting the application. 

The configuration of `Cosmovisor` is done through environment variables, which are documented in the provided link. 

This function is useful for developers who are building applications on top of the Cosmos SDK and want to use `Cosmovisor` as a process manager to manage their application binaries. By calling `GetHelpText()`, developers can get a quick overview of what `Cosmovisor` does and how to configure it. 

Example usage:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"cosmossdk.io/tools/cosmovisor"
)

func main() {
	helpText := GetHelpText()
	fmt.Println(helpText)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a function called `GetHelpText` that returns a multi-line string describing the purpose and functionality of a process manager called Cosmovisor for Cosmos SDK based applications.

2. What is Cosmovisor and how does it work?
- Cosmovisor is a process manager for Cosmos SDK based applications that starts the application by passing all provided arguments and monitors the `upgrade-info.json` file to perform an update. When the blockchain height reaches an approved upgrade proposal, the `upgrade-info.json` file is created by the App x/upgrade module and includes data from the proposal. Cosmovisor interprets that data to perform an update: switch a current binary and restart the App.

3. Where can I find documentation for configuring Cosmovisor?
- Configuration of Cosmovisor is done through environment variables, which are documented in the following link: https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor.
