The `confix` package provides functionality for managing configuration files in the Cosmos SDK project. This file defines a `MigrationMap` type that maps a version string to a function that generates a transformation plan for migrating configuration files from the previous version to the current version. The `PlanBuilder` function is the main workhorse of this package, which takes in two `tomledit.Document` objects representing the old and new configuration files, respectively, and returns a `transform.Plan` object that describes the necessary changes to migrate from the old to the new configuration file.

The `PlanBuilder` function first loads the target configuration file using the `LoadLocalConfig` function defined elsewhere in the package. It then computes the differences between the old and new configuration files using the `DiffKeys` function, which returns a list of `Diff` objects representing the added, deleted, or modified keys and sections between the two files. For each `Diff` object, `PlanBuilder` generates a corresponding `transform.Step` object that describes how to transform the old configuration file to the new one. For example, if a new section is added to the target configuration file, `PlanBuilder` generates a `transform.Step` object that adds the corresponding section to the old configuration file. Similarly, if a key is deleted from the target configuration file, `PlanBuilder` generates a `transform.Step` object that removes the corresponding key from the old configuration file.

The `NoPlan` function is a helper function that returns a no-op plan, indicating that no migration is needed to migrate from the old to the new configuration file. This is used for versions of the Cosmos SDK that are not supported by the `MigrationMap`.

Overall, this file provides a flexible and extensible way to manage configuration files in the Cosmos SDK project, allowing for easy migration between different versions of the SDK. Here is an example of how this package might be used in the larger project:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/confix"
)

func main() {
    // Load the old and new configuration files
    oldConfig, _ := confix.LoadLocalConfig("old.toml")
    newConfig, _ := confix.LoadLocalConfig("new.toml")

    // Get the migration plan for migrating from old to new configuration file
    migrationPlan := confix.Migrations["v0.47"](oldConfig, "new.toml")

    // Apply the migration plan to the old configuration file
    transformedConfig, _ := migrationPlan.Apply(oldConfig)

    // Write the transformed configuration file to disk
    confix.WriteLocalConfig(transformedConfig, "transformed.toml")
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MigrationMap` and `Migrations` variables?
- The `MigrationMap` type is used to define a mapping from a version to a transformation plan, while `Migrations` is a variable that holds a `MigrationMap` instance with specific version keys and corresponding transformation plan functions.
2. What is the purpose of the `PlanBuilder` function?
- The `PlanBuilder` function is used to generate a transformation plan for a given diff between two files. It takes in a `tomledit.Document` instance representing the original file and a string representing the target file, and returns a `transform.Plan` instance that describes the necessary steps to transform the original file into the target file.
3. What is the purpose of the `NoPlan` function?
- The `NoPlan` function returns a no-op plan, meaning it does not perform any transformations. It is used in the `Migrations` variable to indicate that no migration is needed for a specific version.
