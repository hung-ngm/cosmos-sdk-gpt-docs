The `confix` package provides functionality for comparing and printing differences between TOML configuration files. The package defines two main functions, `DiffKeys` and `DiffValues`, which take two TOML documents as input and return a slice of `Diff` structs representing the differences between the two documents. The `Diff` struct contains information about the type of difference (section or mapping), whether the key-value pair was deleted, and the key-value pair itself.

The `DiffKeys` function compares the keyspaces of the two TOML documents, ignoring comments, order, and values. It returns a slice of `Diff` structs representing the differences in the keyspaces. The `DiffValues` function compares the keyspaces of the two TOML documents, including values, and returns a slice of `Diff` structs representing the differences in the keyspaces.

The `PrintDiff` function takes a slice of `Diff` structs and prints the differences to an `io.Writer` in a human-readable format. Each line of output represents a single key-value pair that differs between the two TOML documents. The output format indicates whether the key-value pair was added or deleted, and whether it was a section or mapping.

The `KV` struct represents a key-value pair in a TOML document, including the key, value, and any comment block associated with the key. The `Diff` struct represents a difference between two TOML documents, including the type of difference (section or mapping), whether the key-value pair was deleted, and the key-value pair itself.

Overall, the `confix` package provides a useful set of tools for comparing and printing differences between TOML configuration files. These functions can be used in a larger project to help manage configuration changes and ensure consistency across different environments. For example, the `DiffValues` function could be used to detect configuration changes between a development and production environment, while the `PrintDiff` function could be used to generate a report of the differences for review.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DiffKeys` function?
- The `DiffKeys` function compares the keyspaces of two TOML documents and returns the differences between them in the form of a slice of `Diff` structs.

2. What is the purpose of the `DiffValues` function?
- The `DiffValues` function compares the keyspaces of two TOML documents and returns the differences between them in the form of a slice of `Diff` structs, but it also compares the values of the keys if they exist in both documents.

3. What is the purpose of the `PrintDiff` function?
- The `PrintDiff` function takes a slice of `Diff` structs and prints out the differences between two TOML documents in a human-readable format.
