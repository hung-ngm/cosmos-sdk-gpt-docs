The code above is a part of the cosmos-sdk project and contains two functions that return CLI commands to interactively update and get an application config value. The functions are `SetCommand()` and `GetCommand()`. 

The `SetCommand()` function takes three arguments: `config`, `key`, and `value`. It sets an application config value by updating the specified key with the given value. The function first parses the key by splitting it into its components. It then gets the client context from the command and checks if the home directory is set. If it is, it appends the `config` argument to the home directory path and adds the `.toml` extension to it. The function then creates a `transform.Plan` that contains a single `transform.Func` that updates the specified key with the given value. The function then calls `confix.Upgrade()` with the plan, filename, output path, and validation flag. If the `--stdout` flag is set, the output path is set to an empty string. If the `--verbose` flag is set, the function logs changes to stderr. If the `--skip-validate` flag is set, the function skips configuration validation.

The `GetCommand()` function takes two arguments: `config` and `key`. It gets an application config value by returning the value of the specified key. The function first parses the key by splitting it into its components. It then gets the client context from the command and checks if the home directory is set. If it is, it appends the `config` argument to the home directory path and adds the `.toml` extension to it. The function then calls `confix.LoadConfig()` with the filename to load the config file. It then finds the specified key in the loaded config file and returns its value.

These functions are used to interactively update and get application config values. They are part of the CLI interface for the cosmos-sdk project and can be called from the command line. For example, to set the `mempool.size` key to `1000` in the `config.toml` file, the following command can be used: `cosmos-sdk set config mempool.size 1000`. Similarly, to get the value of the `mempool.size` key in the `config.toml` file, the following command can be used: `cosmos-sdk get config mempool.size`.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code defines two CLI commands, `set` and `get`, that allow users to interactively update and retrieve values from an application configuration file.

2. What external packages does this code use?
- This code imports several external packages, including `confix`, `tomledit`, `parser`, `transform`, and `cobra`.

3. What command line flags are available for the `set` command?
- The `set` command has three available command line flags: `--stdout`, `--verbose`, and `--skip-validate`. The `--stdout` flag prints the updated config to stdout, the `--verbose` flag logs changes to stderr, and the `--skip-validate` flag allows mutation of unknown configurations.
