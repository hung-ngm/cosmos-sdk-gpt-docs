This file contains an implementation of two interfaces from the `rosetta-sdk-go` package: `NetworkInformationProvider` and `OfflineClient`. These interfaces define methods that are used to interact with a blockchain network through the Rosetta API. The purpose of this code is to provide an implementation of these methods specific to the Cosmos SDK blockchain.

The `NetworkInformationProvider` interface defines methods that return information about the network, such as the version and supported operations. The `Version` method returns the version of the Cosmos SDK being used, while `SupportedOperations` returns a list of the supported operations. `OperationStatuses` returns a list of `OperationStatus` objects, which represent the possible statuses of a transaction. In this implementation, there are two possible statuses: `StatusTxSuccess` and `StatusTxReverted`.

The `OfflineClient` interface defines methods that are used to construct and sign transactions offline. `SignedTx` takes in a transaction byte array and a list of signatures and returns the signed transaction byte array. `ConstructionPayload` takes in a `ConstructionPayloadsRequest` object, which contains a list of operations, and returns a `ConstructionPayloadsResponse` object, which contains the unsigned transaction byte array and a list of payloads. `PreprocessOperationsToOptions` takes in a `ConstructionPreprocessRequest` object, which contains a list of operations and metadata, and returns a `ConstructionPreprocessResponse` object, which contains options for constructing the transaction and a list of required public keys. `AccountIdentifierFromPublicKey` takes in a `PublicKey` object and returns an `AccountIdentifier` object.

Overall, this code provides an implementation of the Rosetta API for the Cosmos SDK blockchain, allowing developers to interact with the blockchain in a standardized way. For example, a developer could use the `ConstructionPayload` method to construct an unsigned transaction, then sign it using their own signing tool and the `SignedTx` method.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains implementations of interfaces for the cosmos-rosetta-gateway project, specifically for the NetworkInformationProvider and OfflineClient interfaces.

2. What external packages are being imported in this file and what are they used for?
- The file imports several packages, including `github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/types` which provides types used in the Rosetta API, `cosmossdk.io/tools/rosetta/lib/errors` which provides custom error types, and `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types` which provides types used in the Cosmos SDK.

3. What is the purpose of the `PreprocessOperationsToOptions` function and what does it do?
- The `PreprocessOperationsToOptions` function takes a `ConstructionPreprocessRequest` and returns a `ConstructionPreprocessResponse` containing options for constructing a transaction. It parses the operations to Cosmos SDK messages, gets the signers, and prepares options to return.
