The code defines a Rosetta server that can be used to expose a blockchain's functionality through a standardized API. The server is built using the `github.com/cosmos/rosetta-sdk-go/server` package and is designed to work with the `github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/types` package. 

The `Settings` struct defines the configuration options for the server, including the network information, the client that will handle API requests, the address to listen on, and whether the server should be exposed in offline mode. The `Server` struct contains the HTTP handler, the address to listen on, and a logger. 

The `NewServer` function creates a new Rosetta server using the provided settings. It first creates an asserter using the `github.com/cosmos/rosetta-sdk-go/asserter` package, which is used to validate requests and responses. It then creates an adapter based on whether the server is running in offline or online mode. The adapter is responsible for handling API requests and returning responses. Finally, it creates a new router using the `server.NewRouter` function and returns a new `Server` instance with the router, address, and logger. 

The `newOfflineAdapter` function creates a new offline adapter that can be used to handle API requests when the server is running in offline mode. It returns an error if the client is nil. 

The `newOnlineAdapter` function creates a new online adapter that can be used to handle API requests when the server is running in online mode. It first bootstraps the client using the `Bootstrap` function, which initializes the client and prepares it for use. It then attempts to connect to the client using the `Ready` function, which returns an error if the client is not ready to handle requests. If the client is not ready, it retries a specified number of times with a specified wait time between retries. If the maximum number of retries is exceeded, it returns an error. If the client is ready, it creates a new online network using the `service.NewOnlineNetwork` function and returns the adapter. 

Overall, this code provides a high-level interface for creating a Rosetta server that can be used to expose a blockchain's functionality through a standardized API. It abstracts away many of the low-level details of handling API requests and responses, making it easier to build and maintain a Rosetta server.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a server for the Rosetta API, which is used to interact with blockchain nodes in a standardized way.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several packages, including `net/http`, `os`, `time`, and `github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/types`.

3. What is the difference between an offline and online adapter?
- An offline adapter is used when the Rosetta server is not connected to a live blockchain node, while an online adapter is used when it is connected to a live node. The online adapter includes additional logic to check if the node is ready to serve requests.
