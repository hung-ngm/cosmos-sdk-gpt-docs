The `service` package contains two functions that are used to retrieve information about blocks and transactions in the Cosmos SDK blockchain. These functions are used by the Rosetta API implementation in the Cosmos SDK to provide a standardized interface for interacting with the blockchain.

The `Block` function retrieves the transactions in a given block. It takes a `BlockRequest` object as input, which contains a `BlockIdentifier` field that specifies the block to retrieve. If the `BlockIdentifier` field is not specified, the function assumes that the client is requesting the current block. The function then retrieves the block transactions using the `BlockTransactionsByHash` or `BlockTransactionsByHeight` methods of the `client` object, depending on whether the `BlockIdentifier` specifies a block hash or index. If neither a hash nor an index is specified, the function retrieves the transactions for the current block. The function then checks that the retrieved block matches the `BlockIdentifier` specified in the request and returns a `BlockResponse` object containing the block information.

The `BlockTransaction` function retrieves a specific transaction in a given block. It takes a `BlockTransactionRequest` object as input, which contains a `TransactionIdentifier` field that specifies the transaction to retrieve. The function retrieves the transaction using the `GetTx` method of the `client` object and returns a `BlockTransactionResponse` object containing the transaction information.

These functions are used by the Rosetta API implementation in the Cosmos SDK to provide a standardized interface for interacting with the blockchain. By implementing the Rosetta API, the Cosmos SDK can be integrated with other blockchain tools and services that support the Rosetta API, making it easier for developers to build on the Cosmos SDK.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Block` function?
- The `Block` function gets the transactions in the given block.

2. What is the purpose of the `BlockTransaction` function?
- The `BlockTransaction` function gets the given transaction in the specified block.

3. What is the significance of the `BlockIdentifier` parameter in the `Block` function?
- The `BlockIdentifier` parameter is mandatory by spec 1.4.10 and is used to fetch data by block identifier. If neither the index nor hash is specified, it is assumed that the client is making a request at the current block.
