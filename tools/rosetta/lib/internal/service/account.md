The `service` package contains code that interacts with the blockchain network and provides functionality to the Rosetta API. The `AccountBalance` function retrieves the account balance of a given address. The function takes in a context and an `AccountBalanceRequest` object and returns an `AccountBalanceResponse` object and an error object. The function first checks the `BlockIdentifier` field of the request object to determine which block to fetch information from. If the `BlockIdentifier` is nil, the function fetches the current block information and sets the `BlockIdentifier` field of the response object to the current block. If the `BlockIdentifier` contains a hash, the function fetches the block information using the hash and sets the `BlockIdentifier` field of the response object to the fetched block. If the `BlockIdentifier` contains an index, the function fetches the block information using the index and sets the `BlockIdentifier` field of the response object to the fetched block. The function then fetches the account coins using the `Balances` function of the client object and sets the `Balances` field of the response object to the fetched account coins. Finally, the function returns the response object and a nil error object.

The `AccountCoins` function is not relevant for this blockchain network and returns an error object indicating that the network is offline.

This code is part of the larger cosmos-sdk project and provides functionality to the Rosetta API. The `AccountBalance` function is used to retrieve the account balance of a given address and is called by the Rosetta API when a client requests account balance information. The `AccountCoins` function is not used in this blockchain network and is provided for compatibility with the Rosetta API.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AccountCoins` function?
- The `AccountCoins` function is relevant only for UTXO based chain and returns an error indicating that the network is offline.

2. What is the purpose of the `AccountBalance` function?
- The `AccountBalance` function retrieves the account balance of an address and fetches the block information as required by Rosetta.

3. What is the role of the `errors` package imported in this file?
- The `errors` package is used to convert errors returned by the client into Rosetta errors.
