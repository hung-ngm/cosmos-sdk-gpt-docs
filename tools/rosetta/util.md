This file contains three functions related to metadata and time conversion. The purpose of this code is to provide utility functions for working with metadata in the context of the Rosetta API. 

The first function, `timeToMilliseconds`, takes a `time.Time` object and returns its Unix timestamp in milliseconds. This function is useful for converting timestamps to a format that can be used in the Rosetta API.

The second function, `unmarshalMetadata`, takes a map of metadata and unmarshals it into a target object. This function is useful for decoding metadata that has been encoded as JSON. The function first marshals the metadata to a byte slice, then unmarshals it into the target object. If there is an error during either step, the function returns an error.

The third function, `marshalMetadata`, takes an interface and marshals it to a map of metadata. This function is useful for encoding metadata as JSON. The function first marshals the interface to a byte slice, then unmarshals it into a map of metadata. If there is an error during either step, the function returns an error.

These functions are likely used in other parts of the Rosetta API to encode and decode metadata. For example, when a block is returned by the API, it may include metadata that needs to be decoded before it can be used. Similarly, when a transaction is submitted to the API, it may include metadata that needs to be encoded before it can be sent to the network. 

Example usage of these functions:

```
// Convert a time to milliseconds
t := time.Now()
ms := timeToMilliseconds(t)

// Decode metadata from a map
meta := map[string]interface{}{
    "foo": "bar",
    "baz": 123,
}
var target struct {
    Foo string `json:"foo"`
    Baz int    `json:"baz"`
}
err := unmarshalMetadata(meta, &target)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Encode metadata to a map
data := struct {
    Foo string `json:"foo"`
    Baz int    `json:"baz"`
}{
    Foo: "bar",
    Baz: 123,
}
meta, err := marshalMetadata(data)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains functions for converting time to milliseconds timestamp and marshaling/unmarshaling metadata to/from map[string]interface{}.

2. What is the input and output of the `timeToMilliseconds` function?
- The input is a `time.Time` object and the output is an `int64` representing the milliseconds timestamp.

3. What is the error handling strategy used in the `unmarshalMetadata` function?
- The function returns an error if there is an error in marshaling or unmarshaling the metadata, and wraps the error with a custom error type defined in the `crgerrs` package.
