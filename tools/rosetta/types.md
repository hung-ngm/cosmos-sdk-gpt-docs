This file contains various constants and structs used in the Rosetta implementation of the Cosmos SDK. The Rosetta API is a standard interface for blockchain applications, and the Cosmos SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications. The purpose of this file is to define the metadata options and transaction types used in the Rosetta implementation of the Cosmos SDK.

The file defines several constants, including the statuses of transactions and the size of different types of transactions. It also defines the identifier for a burner address, which is used to represent coins that have been burned in the SDK. Additionally, it defines the different types of transactions that can be represented in Rosetta, including begin block, end block, and deliver transactions.

The file also defines several structs used to represent metadata options in the Rosetta API. The `ConstructionPreprocessMetadata` struct is used to represent metadata that can be provided during preprocess options. The `PreprocessOperationsOptionsResponse` struct is the structured metadata options returned by the preprocess operations endpoint. The `SignerData` struct contains information on the signers when the request is being created, used to populate the account information. Finally, the `ConstructionMetadata` struct is used to construct a transaction and is fed to `ConstructionPayload` to process the bytes to sign.

Overall, this file is an important part of the Rosetta implementation of the Cosmos SDK, as it defines the metadata options and transaction types used in the API. Developers building blockchain applications using the Cosmos SDK can use this file to ensure their applications are compatible with the Rosetta API.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionType` constant and how is it used in the code?
- The `TransactionType` constant is used to distinguish between different types of transactions (begin block, end block, and deliver tx) based on their hash.
2. What is the significance of the `BurnerAddressIdentifier` constant and why is it used?
- The `BurnerAddressIdentifier` constant is used to represent the account identifier of a burner address, to which all coins burned in the sdk will be sent. This address cannot be queried and is used because Rosetta does not understand supply contraction.
3. What is the difference between `ConstructionPreprocessMetadata` and `PreprocessOperationsOptionsResponse` and how are they used in the code?
- `ConstructionPreprocessMetadata` is used to represent metadata that Rosetta can provide during preprocess options, while `PreprocessOperationsOptionsResponse` is the structured metadata options returned by the preprocess operations endpoint. Both are used to set metadata options for constructing a transaction, but `PreprocessOperationsOptionsResponse` includes additional fields such as `ExpectedSigners`.
