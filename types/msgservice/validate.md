The `msgservice` package contains functions for validating protocol buffer (protobuf) messages used in the Cosmos SDK. The `ValidateProtoAnnotations` function validates that the proto annotations are correct. Specifically, it verifies that all services named "Msg" have `(cosmos.msg.v1.service) = true`. This is done by iterating over all the files in the `protoFiles` parameter (or `protoregistry.GlobalFiles` if `protoFiles` is nil), and for each file, iterating over all the services in the file. If a service is named "Msg", the `validateMsgServiceAnnotations` function is called to check if the service has the `(cosmos.msg.v1.service) = true` proto annotation. If the annotation is not present, an error is returned.

The `validateMsgServiceAnnotations` function validates that the service has the `(cosmos.msg.v1.service) = true` proto annotation. This is done by getting the extension field from the service options using `proto.GetExtension`, and checking if it is a boolean value. If the extension is not a boolean, an error is returned. If the extension is a boolean but is not true, an error is returned.

This code is used to ensure that all protobuf messages used in the Cosmos SDK have the correct annotations. This is important because the SDK uses protobuf messages to communicate between different components, and having incorrect annotations can cause issues with message parsing and handling. Developers using the Cosmos SDK can use this code to validate their own protobuf messages and ensure that they are correctly annotated. For example, a developer could call `ValidateProtoAnnotations` on their own set of protobuf files to ensure that all services named "Msg" have the correct annotation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code validates that the proto annotations are correct, specifically verifying that all services named "Msg" have `(cosmos.msg.v1.service) = true`.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports the following packages: "errors", "fmt", "google.golang.org/protobuf/proto", "google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect", and "google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoregistry". It also imports a custom package "cosmossdk.io/api/cosmos/msg/v1".

3. What is the expected input and output of the `ValidateProtoAnnotations` function?
- The `ValidateProtoAnnotations` function takes in an optional argument `protoFiles` which is a pointer to a `protoregistry.Files` object. If `protoFiles` is nil, then `protoregistry.GlobalFile` will be used. The function returns an error.
