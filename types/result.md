This file contains various utility functions and types used in the cosmos-sdk project. 

The `GasInfo` and `Result` types have `String()` methods that return a string representation of the object in YAML format. These methods are used to print out the objects in a human-readable format. 

The `ABCIMessageLogs` type is a slice of `ABCIMessageLog` objects, which represent the logs generated by an ABCI transaction. The `NewABCIMessageLog()` function creates a new `ABCIMessageLog` object with the given message index, log message, and events. The `String()` method of `ABCIMessageLogs` returns a string representation of the slice in JSON format. 

The `NewResponseResultTx()` function takes a `ResultTx` object from Tendermint and returns a `TxResponse` object. The `TxResponse` object contains information about the transaction, such as the transaction hash, height, code, data, gas used, and events. The `NewResponseResultBlock()` function takes a `ResultBlock` object from CometBFT and returns a `Block` object. The `Block` object contains the header, data, evidence, and last commit of the block. These functions are used to convert the result objects from Tendermint and CometBFT into the appropriate response objects for the cosmos-sdk API. 

The `NewSearchTxsResult()` and `NewSearchBlocksResult()` functions create new search result objects for transactions and blocks, respectively. These objects contain information about the search results, such as the total count, count per page, page number, page total, limit, and the transactions or blocks themselves. 

The `ParseABCILogs()` function attempts to parse a stringified ABCI transaction log into a slice of `ABCIMessageLog` objects. This function is used to parse the logs generated by an ABCI transaction. 

The `WrapServiceResult()` function wraps a result from a protobuf RPC service method call in a `Result` object or error. This function takes care of marshaling the result parameter to protobuf and attaching any events on the context's event manager to the `Result`. 

The `calcTotalPages()` function calculates the total number of pages given the total count and limit per page. This function is used to calculate the total number of pages for search results. 

Overall, this file provides various utility functions and types that are used throughout the cosmos-sdk project to handle responses from Tendermint and CometBFT, parse transaction logs, and create search result objects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `cdc` variable?
- The `cdc` variable is an instance of the `codec.LegacyAmino` type and is used for encoding and decoding data in the Amino format.

2. What is the `WrapServiceResult` function used for?
- The `WrapServiceResult` function is used to wrap the result of a protobuf RPC service method call in a `Result` object or error. It also marshals the result to protobuf and attaches any events on the context's event manager to the `Result`.

3. What is the purpose of the `UnpackInterfaces` method in the `SearchTxsResult` and `TxResponse` types?
- The `UnpackInterfaces` method is used to unpack any nested interfaces in the `TxResponse` and `SearchTxsResult` types. This is necessary because there are generally interfaces to unpack in transactions.
