The `address` package provides functionality for creating and manipulating addresses in the Cosmos SDK project. The package defines an `Addressable` interface that can be implemented by any type that can be used to derive an address. The package also provides functions for creating and composing addresses.

The `Hash` function takes a type string and a key byte slice and returns a new address. The function uses the SHA256 hash function to hash the type string and the key byte slice. The resulting hash is then used to hash the key byte slice again, and the final hash is returned as the address. This function is intended to be used by new types that define their own address function.

The `Compose` function takes a type string and a slice of `Addressable` objects and returns a new address. The function first converts each `Addressable` object to a length-prefixed byte slice and sorts the resulting slices. The function then concatenates the sorted byte slices and hashes the result using the `Hash` function. This function is used to create a new address based on sub-addresses.

The `Module` function is a specialized version of the `Compose` function for creating module addresses. The function takes a module name and a sequence of derivation keys and returns a new address. The function first hashes the module name using the `crypto.AddressHash` function and then appends a zero byte to avoid potential clashes between the module name and the first derivation key. The function then uses the `Hash` function to hash the module name and the first derivation key and derives subsequent addresses using the `Derive` function.

The `Derive` function takes an address and a key byte slice and returns a new address. The function uses the `Hash` function to hash the address and the key byte slice and returns the resulting hash as the new address. This function is used to create sub-accounts.

Overall, the `address` package provides a set of functions for creating and manipulating addresses in the Cosmos SDK project. These functions can be used to create new addresses based on sub-addresses or to derive new addresses from existing ones. The `Module` function is a specialized version of the `Compose` function for creating module addresses, which are used to represent module accounts in the Cosmos SDK project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Addressable` interface?
- The `Addressable` interface represents any type from which an address can be derived.

2. What is the difference between the `Hash` and `Compose` functions?
- The `Hash` function creates a new address from an address type and key, while the `Compose` function creates a new address based on sub addresses.

3. What is the purpose of the `Module` function?
- The `Module` function is a specialized version of a composed address for modules, used to construct a module account from a module name and a sequence of derivation keys.
