This file contains constants and functions related to the consensus mechanism in the cosmos-sdk project. The consensus mechanism is responsible for ensuring that all nodes in the network agree on the state of the blockchain. 

The `ValidatorUpdateDelay` constant represents the delay, in blocks, between when validator updates are returned to the consensus engine and when they are applied. This value is constant and should not change without a hard fork. For CometBFT, a specific consensus algorithm, this value is set to 1 block. 

The `DefaultBondDenom` variable represents the default bondable coin denomination, which defaults to "stake". Overwriting this value has the side effect of changing the default denomination in genesis. 

The `DefaultPowerReduction` variable represents the default amount of staking tokens required for 1 unit of consensus engine power. 

The `TokensToConsensusPower` function takes in an amount of tokens and a power reduction value and returns the potential consensus engine power that can be obtained from those tokens. 

Example usage:
```
tokens := sdkmath.NewIntFromUint64(1000000)
powerReduction := sdkmath.NewIntFromUint64(100)
consensusPower := TokensToConsensusPower(tokens, powerReduction)
fmt.Println(consensusPower) // Output: 10000
```

The `TokensFromConsensusPower` function takes in a power value and a power reduction value and returns the amount of tokens required to obtain that power. 

Example usage:
```
power := int64(10000)
powerReduction := sdkmath.NewIntFromUint64(100)
tokens := TokensFromConsensusPower(power, powerReduction)
fmt.Println(tokens) // Output: 1000000
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DefaultBondDenom` variable?
   - `DefaultBondDenom` is the default bondable coin denomination and is used to determine the default denomination in genesis.

2. What is the purpose of the `TokensToConsensusPower` function?
   - `TokensToConsensusPower` is used to convert input tokens to potential consensus-engine power.

3. What is the purpose of the `ValidatorUpdateDelay` constant?
   - `ValidatorUpdateDelay` is the delay, in blocks, between when validator updates are returned to the consensus-engine and when they are applied. It is set to 1 block for CometBFT and is expected to remain constant without a hard fork.
