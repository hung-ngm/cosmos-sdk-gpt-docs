The `module` package provides an interface called `Configurator` that allows modules to configure and register their services. The `Configurator` interface is designed to support module object capabilities isolation. The `configurator` struct implements the `Configurator` interface and provides methods to register services, register migrations, and run module migrations.

The `RegisterService` method registers a service with the `grpc.Server` instance. It checks if the service is a message service or a query service and registers it accordingly with the `MsgServer` or `QueryServer` instance.

The `Error` method returns the last error encountered during the `RegisterService` method.

The `NewConfigurator` function returns a new `Configurator` instance with the provided codec, message server, and query server.

The `MsgServer` and `QueryServer` methods return the `grpc.Server` instance for message services and query services, respectively.

The `RegisterMigration` method registers an in-place store migration for a module. It takes the module name, the starting version, and a migration handler as arguments. The `migrations` map stores the migration handler for each module and version.

The `runModuleMigrations` method runs all in-place store migrations for a given module from a version to another version. It takes the module name, the starting version, and the ending version as arguments. It retrieves the migration handler for each version and runs it sequentially until the ending version.

Overall, the `module` package provides an interface for modules to configure and register their services and migrations. It allows for module object capabilities isolation and provides methods to register services, register migrations, and run module migrations.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Configurator` interface?
- The `Configurator` interface provides hooks for modules to configure and register their services in the `RegisterServices` method, and also supports module object capabilities isolation.

2. What is the `migrations` field used for in the `configurator` struct?
- The `migrations` field is a map of moduleName -> fromVersion -> migration script handler, used to register in-place store migrations for a module.

3. What does the `runModuleMigrations` method do?
- The `runModuleMigrations` method runs all in-place store migrations for a given module from a version to another version, sequentially, until the toVersion is reached.
