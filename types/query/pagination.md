The `query` package provides functionality for pagination and querying of data stored in the `cosmos-sdk`. The `Paginate` function is the main function in this package and is used to paginate all the results in the `PrefixStore` based on the provided `PageRequest`. The `onResult` function is used to do actual unmarshaling of the data. 

The `ParsePagination` function is used to validate the `PageRequest` and returns the page number and limit. The `DefaultPage` and `DefaultLimit` constants are used as default values for the page number and limit respectively. The `MaxLimit` constant is the maximum limit that the `Paginate` function can handle. 

The `Paginate` function takes in a `prefixStore` of type `types.KVStore`, a `pageRequest` of type `PageRequest`, and an `onResult` function. The `pageRequest` is used to specify the pagination parameters such as the offset, key, limit, countTotal, and reverse. If the `pageRequest` is nil, the default `PageRequest` is used. 

The `getIterator` function is used to get an iterator for the `prefixStore` based on the start key and reverse flag. If the reverse flag is true, the iterator is returned in reverse order. 

The `Paginate` function then uses the `getIterator` function to get an iterator for the `prefixStore` based on the `key` and `reverse` flag. If the `key` is not empty, the iterator is used to paginate the results based on the `key`. If the `key` is empty, the iterator is used to paginate all the results in the `prefixStore`. 

The `onResult` function is then used to unmarshal the data and the `PageResponse` is returned. The `PageResponse` contains the `NextKey` and `Total` fields. The `NextKey` field is used to get the next set of results and the `Total` field is used to get the total number of results. 

Overall, the `query` package provides functionality for pagination and querying of data stored in the `cosmos-sdk`. The `Paginate` function is the main function in this package and is used to paginate all the results in the `PrefixStore` based on the provided `PageRequest`. The `onResult` function is used to do actual unmarshaling of the data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Paginate` function?
- The `Paginate` function is used to paginate all the results in the `PrefixStore` based on the provided `PageRequest`, and `onResult` should be used to do actual unmarshaling.

2. What is the purpose of the `ParsePagination` function?
- The `ParsePagination` function is used to validate `PageRequest` and returns the page number and limit.

3. What is the purpose of the `MaxLimit` constant?
- The `MaxLimit` constant is the maximum limit the `Paginate` function can handle, which equals the maximum value that can be stored in `uint64`.
