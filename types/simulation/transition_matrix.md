The `simulation` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to simulating the behavior of the blockchain network. This particular file defines an interface called `TransitionMatrix` which is used to represent a transition matrix for a Markov chain. 

A Markov chain is a mathematical model used to describe a system that transitions between different states over time. In the context of a blockchain network, this could represent the different states that the network can be in, such as the state where a block is being validated or the state where transactions are being processed. The `TransitionMatrix` interface defines a method called `NextState` which takes a random number generator and the current state as input, and returns the next state in the chain. 

The `TransitionMatrix` interface is not a complete implementation of a left stochastic matrix, which is a type of matrix used in Markov chain analysis. However, it is almost a left stochastic matrix, and can be easily converted to one by normalizing the column values. 

This interface can be used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to simulate the behavior of the blockchain network over time. By defining different implementations of the `TransitionMatrix` interface, developers can model different aspects of the network's behavior and test how it responds to different scenarios. For example, one implementation could model the behavior of validators in the network, while another could model the behavior of users submitting transactions. 

Here is an example of how the `NextState` method could be used in an implementation of the `TransitionMatrix` interface:

```go
type ValidatorMatrix struct {
    // implementation details
}

func (vm ValidatorMatrix) NextState(r *rand.Rand, i int) int {
    // calculate the probability of transitioning to each state
    // based on the current state and the behavior of validators
    // return the next state based on the probabilities
}
```

In this example, `ValidatorMatrix` is an implementation of the `TransitionMatrix` interface that models the behavior of validators in the network. The `NextState` method calculates the probability of transitioning to each state based on the current state and the behavior of validators, and returns the next state based on those probabilities.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TransitionMatrix` interface?
- The `TransitionMatrix` interface is used to define a method `NextState` that takes a `rand.Rand` and an integer `i` as input and returns an integer. It is used to represent a transition matrix that is almost a left stochastic matrix.

2. Why is the `TransitionMatrix` not a left stochastic matrix?
- The `TransitionMatrix` is not a left stochastic matrix because the column values are not normalized. However, it is noted that normalizing the column values in the future would make it a stochastic matrix.

3. Why are floats not used as the default in the `TransitionMatrix`?
- Floats are not used as the default in the `TransitionMatrix` due to non-determinism across architectures.
