The `types` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains the `EventManager` interface and its implementation. The `EventManager` interface defines a set of methods that allow for the management of events. Events are used to notify other parts of the system about changes or actions that have occurred. The `EventManager` interface provides methods to store and retrieve events, as well as methods to emit events in different formats.

The `EventManager` implementation is a simple wrapper around a slice of `Event` objects. It provides methods to store and retrieve events, as well as methods to emit events in different formats. The `EventManager` implementation also provides methods to convert between typed events and `Event` objects. Typed events are messages that implement the `proto.Message` interface. The `TypedEventToEvent` method takes a typed event and converts it into an `Event` object. The `ParseTypedEvent` method takes an `Event` object and converts it back into a typed event.

The `Event` type is an alias for an ABCI event, which is a type defined in the `github.com/cometbft/cometbft/abci/types` package. The `Events` type is a slice of `Event` objects. The `NewEvent` function creates a new `Event` object with a given type and one or more attributes. The `NewAttribute` function returns a new key/value `Attribute` object. The `EmptyEvents` function returns an empty slice of events.

The `EventManager` implementation also defines a set of common event types and attribute keys. These are used to standardize the format of events across the system. The `StringEvents` type is a slice of `StringEvent` objects, which are used to represent events as strings. The `StringifyEvent` function converts an `Event` object to a `StringEvent` object. The `StringifyEvents` function converts a slice of `Event` objects into a slice of `StringEvent` objects. The `MarkEventsToIndex` function marks the index value of each attribute in a set of events based on a provided set of events to index.

Overall, the `EventManager` interface and its implementation provide a simple and flexible way to manage events in the `cosmos-sdk` project. The interface allows for the storage and retrieval of events, as well as the emission of events in different formats. The implementation provides a set of common event types and attribute keys to standardize the format of events across the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EventManager` struct and its associated methods?
- The `EventManager` struct is a simple wrapper around a slice of `Event` objects that can be emitted from. Its associated methods allow for the storage and emission of `Event` objects, as well as conversion of typed events to `Event` objects.

2. What is the purpose of the `TypedEventToEvent` function?
- The `TypedEventToEvent` function takes a typed event and converts it into an `Event` object, which can be stored and emitted by the `EventManager`. It does this by marshaling the typed event to JSON, sorting the resulting key-value pairs, and creating a slice of `abci.EventAttribute` objects from the sorted key-value pairs.

3. What is the purpose of the `MarkEventsToIndex` function?
- The `MarkEventsToIndex` function takes a slice of `abci.Event` objects and a set of events to index, and returns a new slice of `abci.Event` objects where each attribute has its index value marked based on the provided set of events to index. This is useful for indexing specific events and attributes for querying purposes.
