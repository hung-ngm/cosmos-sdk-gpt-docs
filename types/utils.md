This file contains various utility functions that are used throughout the cosmos-sdk project. These functions are used to perform tasks such as sorting JSON, converting uint64 to big-endian byte slices, formatting time into a byte slice, and logging errors in deferred function calls.

The `SortJSON` function takes any JSON and returns it sorted by keys. This method can be used to canonicalize JSON to be returned by `GetSignBytes`, for example, for the ledger integration. If the passed JSON isn't valid, it will return an error. The `MustSortJSON` function is similar to `SortJSON`, but it panics if an error occurs.

The `Uint64ToBigEndian` function marshals uint64 to a big-endian byte slice so it can be sorted. The `BigEndianToUint64` function returns an uint64 from big-endian encoded bytes. If encoding is empty, zero is returned.

The `FormatTimeBytes` function formats a `time.Time` into a byte slice that can be sorted. The `FormatTimeString` function formats a `time.Time` into a string. The `ParseTimeBytes` function parses a byte slice encoded using `FormatTimeKey` back into a `time.Time`. The `ParseTime` function parses an encoded type using `FormatTimeKey` back into a `time.Time`.

The `CopyBytes` function copies bytes. The `AppendLengthPrefixedBytes` function combines the slices of bytes to one slice of bytes. The `ParseLengthPrefixedBytes` function panics when store key length is not equal to the given length.

The `LogDeferred` function logs an error in a deferred function call if the returned error is non-nil. It takes a logger and a function as arguments. If the function returns an error, it logs the error using the logger.

Overall, these utility functions are used to perform various tasks such as sorting, formatting, and logging errors. They are used throughout the cosmos-sdk project to provide common functionality and improve code readability.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `SortJSON` function do and why might it be useful?
- The `SortJSON` function takes any JSON and returns it sorted by keys, removing all white-spaces. It can be used to canonicalize JSON to be returned by `GetSignBytes`, for example, for the ledger integration.

2. What is the purpose of the `Uint64ToBigEndian` and `BigEndianToUint64` functions?
- The `Uint64ToBigEndian` function marshals a uint64 to a big-endian byte slice so it can be sorted. The `BigEndianToUint64` function returns an uint64 from big-endian encoded bytes.

3. What is the purpose of the `LogDeferred` function and how is it used?
- The `LogDeferred` function logs an error in a deferred function call if the returned error is non-nil. It takes a logger and a function as arguments, and if the function returns an error, it logs the error message using the logger. It can be used to ensure that errors are logged even if they occur in a deferred function call.
