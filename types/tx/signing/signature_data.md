The `signing` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to cryptographic signing of transactions. The code in this file defines two structs, `SingleSignatureData` and `MultiSignatureData`, which represent the signature and signing mode of a single signer and the nested signature data of a multisig signature, respectively. 

The `SignatureData` interface is a convenience type that is easier to use in business logic than the encoded protobuf ModeInfo's and raw signatures. It is implemented by both `SingleSignatureData` and `MultiSignatureData`. 

`SingleSignatureData` contains two fields: `SignMode`, which represents the signing mode of the signature, and `Signature`, which is the raw signature. 

`MultiSignatureData` contains two fields: `BitArray`, which is a compact way of indicating which signers from the multisig key have signed, and `Signatures`, which is a slice of `SignatureData` representing the nested signature data for each signer. 

The last three lines of the code define two methods, `isSignatureData()`, which are used to implement the `SignatureData` interface. 

Overall, this code provides a way to represent and work with cryptographic signature data in a convenient way for business logic. It can be used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project for signing transactions and verifying signatures. 

Example usage:

```
// create a SingleSignatureData object
sigData := &SingleSignatureData{
    SignMode: SignMode_SIGN_MODE_DIRECT,
    Signature: []byte{0x01, 0x02, 0x03},
}

// create a MultiSignatureData object
multiSigData := &MultiSignatureData{
    BitArray: &types.CompactBitArray{Bits: []byte{0x01, 0x02}},
    Signatures: []SignatureData{sigData},
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SignatureData` interface and how is it used in the code?
- The `SignatureData` interface is a convenience type that represents either a `SingleSignatureData` or `MultiSignatureData`. It is used in business logic instead of the encoded protobuf `ModeInfo` and raw signatures.

2. What is the difference between `SingleSignatureData` and `MultiSignatureData`?
- `SingleSignatureData` represents the signature and `SignMode` of a single non-multisig signer, while `MultiSignatureData` represents the nested `SignatureData` of a multisig signature, including the `BitArray` indicating which signers have signed and the `Signatures` for each signer.

3. What is the purpose of the `isSignatureData()` method in `SingleSignatureData` and `MultiSignatureData`?
- The `isSignatureData()` method is used to ensure that both `SingleSignatureData` and `MultiSignatureData` implement the `SignatureData` interface. It is a way to enforce type safety and avoid runtime errors.
