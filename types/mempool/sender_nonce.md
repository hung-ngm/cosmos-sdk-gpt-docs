The `SenderNonceMempool` is a mempool implementation that prioritizes transactions within a sender by nonce, the lowest first, but selects a random sender on each iteration. The mempool is iterated by maintaining a separate list of nonce-ordered transactions per sender. For each select iteration, a sender is randomly chosen, and the next nonce-ordered transaction from their list is picked. This process is repeated until the mempool is exhausted. The `SenderNonceMempool` is used to store transactions that are waiting to be included in a block. 

The `SenderNonceMempool` is created using the `NewSenderNonceMempool` function, which takes in optional arguments to set the maximum number of transactions and the seed for the random number generator. The `Insert` function is used to add a transaction to the mempool. It returns an error if the transaction does not have at least one signer. The `Select` function returns an iterator ordering transactions in the mempool with the lowest nonce of a randomly selected sender first. The `CountTx` function returns the total count of transactions in the mempool. The `Remove` function removes a transaction from the mempool. It returns an error if the transaction does not have at least one signer or the transaction was not found in the pool.

The `SenderNonceMempool` is part of the `cosmos-sdk` project and is used to store transactions that are waiting to be included in a block. It is designed to prioritize transactions within a sender by nonce, which is important for preventing replay attacks. The `SenderNonceMempool` is used by other modules in the `cosmos-sdk` project, such as the `bank` module, which handles the transfer of tokens between accounts.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this mempool implementation and how does it differ from other mempool implementations?
- This mempool implementation prioritizes transactions within a sender by nonce, the lowest first, but selects a random sender on each iteration. It maintains a separate list of nonce-ordered transactions per sender and randomly chooses a sender and picks the next nonce-ordered transaction from their list for each select iteration. 

2. What are the options available when creating a new SenderNonceMempool instance?
- There are two options available when creating a new SenderNonceMempool instance: SenderNonceSeedOpt and SenderNonceMaxTxOpt. SenderNonceSeedOpt is used to add a seed for random type when calling the constructor NewSenderNonceMempool. SenderNonceMaxTxOpt is used to set the limit of max tx when calling the constructor NewSenderNonceMempool.

3. Is it safe to use the Select iterator while removing transactions from the underlying mempool?
- No, it is not safe to use the Select iterator while removing transactions from the underlying mempool.
