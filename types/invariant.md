This file defines several types and functions related to invariants in the cosmos-sdk project. Invariants are functions that test a particular condition or constraint in the system and return a descriptive message about what happened and a boolean indicating whether the invariant has been broken. If an invariant is broken, the simulator will halt and print the logs.

The `Invariant` type is defined as a function that takes a `Context` object as input and returns a string and a boolean. The `Invariants` type is defined as a slice of `Invariant` functions. These types are used to define and group invariants in the system.

The `InvariantRegistry` interface is defined with a single method `RegisterRoute` that takes a module name, a route, and an `Invariant` function as input. This interface is expected to be implemented by modules that want to register their own invariants with the system.

The `FormatInvariant` function is defined to return a standardized message for an invariant. It takes a module name, an invariant name, and a message as input and returns a formatted string.

Overall, this code provides a framework for defining and registering invariants in the cosmos-sdk project. Modules can define their own invariants and register them with the system using the `InvariantRegistry` interface. The `FormatInvariant` function provides a standardized way to format the messages returned by the invariants.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InvariantRegistry` interface?
- The `InvariantRegistry` interface defines the expected interface for registering invariants with a specific module and route.

2. What is the expected input and output of an `Invariant` function?
- An `Invariant` function takes in a `Context` object and returns a descriptive message about what happened and a boolean indicating whether the invariant has been broken.

3. What does the `FormatInvariant` function do?
- The `FormatInvariant` function takes in a module name, invariant name, and message and returns a standardized invariant message in a specific format.
