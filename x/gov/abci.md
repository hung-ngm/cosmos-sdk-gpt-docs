The `EndBlocker` function is a part of the `gov` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project. It is called every block and is responsible for processing proposals that are in the inactive or active state. The function takes two arguments: `ctx` of type `sdk.Context` and `keeper` of type `*keeper.Keeper`. 

The function first processes inactive proposals that did not receive enough deposits to enter the voting phase. It deletes these proposals from the store and returns their deposits. If the `BurnProposalDepositPrevote` parameter is set to true, the deposits are burned; otherwise, they are refunded. The function then emits an event indicating that the proposal is inactive and logs information about the proposal. 

Next, the function fetches active proposals whose voting periods have ended and tallies the votes. If the proposal passes, the function attempts to execute all messages within the proposal. If all handlers pass, the proposal status is set to `StatusPassed`, and the state is written to the underlying multi-store. If any handler fails, the proposal status is set to `StatusFailed`, and the error message is logged. If the proposal fails, the function sets the proposal status to `StatusRejected`. 

If an expedited proposal fails, it is converted to a regular proposal, and the voting period is extended. Once the regular voting period expires, the tally is repeated according to the regular proposal rules. The function then sets the proposal status, logs information about the proposal, and emits an event indicating the proposal's status. 

Overall, the `EndBlocker` function is a critical component of the `gov` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project. It ensures that proposals are processed correctly and that their deposits are handled appropriately. It also executes messages within proposals and logs information about the proposals.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EndBlocker` function?
- The `EndBlocker` function is called every block and processes inflation and updates the validator set. It also deletes dead proposals from the store and returns their deposits, and fetches active proposals whose voting periods have ended.

2. What happens to a proposal if it fails to meet the minimum deposit?
- If a proposal fails to meet the minimum deposit, it is deleted and its deposits are either refunded or burned depending on the value of `BurnProposalDepositPrevote` in the keeper's parameters. The `AfterProposalFailedMinDeposit` hook is also called, and an event is emitted with the proposal ID and the result of "proposal dropped".

3. What happens if an expedited proposal fails?
- If an expedited proposal fails, it is converted to a regular proposal and the voting period is extended. The deposits are either deleted or refunded, and the `AttributeValueExpeditedProposalRejected` tag is added to the event.
