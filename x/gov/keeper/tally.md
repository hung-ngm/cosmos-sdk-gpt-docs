The `Tally` function in the `keeper` package of the `cosmos-sdk` project is responsible for tallying the votes for a given proposal and determining whether it passes or fails. The function takes in a context and a proposal and returns a boolean indicating whether the proposal passes or fails, a boolean indicating whether the deposits should be burned, and a `TallyResult` object that contains the results of the tally.

The function first initializes a map to store the results of the tally for each vote option. It then fetches all the bonded validators and inserts them into a map called `currValidators`. The function then iterates over all the votes for the proposal and records the vote in the `currValidators` map if the voter is a validator. If the voter is a delegator, the function iterates over all the delegations from the voter and deducts the delegation shares from any delegated-to validators. The function then calculates the voting power of the delegator and adds it to the tally for each vote option.

After iterating over all the votes, the function iterates over the validators again to tally their voting power. It then calculates the percentage of total voting power and checks if it meets the quorum requirement. If the quorum requirement is not met, the proposal fails. The function then checks if there are any votes for the proposal. If there are no votes, the proposal fails. If more than 1/3 of voters veto the proposal, it fails. If more than 1/2 of non-abstaining voters vote yes, the proposal passes. If more than 1/2 of non-abstaining voters vote no, the proposal fails.

The `Tally` function is an important part of the governance module in the `cosmos-sdk` project. It allows for the community to vote on proposals and determine whether they should be implemented. The function is called by other functions in the governance module to determine the outcome of a proposal. For example, the `EndBlocker` function in the governance module calls the `Tally` function to determine the outcome of proposals that have reached their voting end time. 

Example usage:

```
proposal := v1.Proposal{
    Id: 1,
    Content: content,
    Status: v1.ProposalStatusVotingPeriod,
    SubmitTime: time.Now(),
    DepositEndTime: time.Now().Add(time.Hour * 24),
    TotalDeposit: sdk.NewCoins(sdk.NewCoin("stake", sdk.NewInt(100))),
    VotingStartTime: time.Now().Add(time.Hour * 24),
    VotingEndTime: time.Now().Add(time.Hour * 48),
}

passes, burnDeposits, tallyResults := keeper.Tally(ctx, proposal)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Tally` function?
- The `Tally` function updates the tally of a proposal based on the voting power of the voters.

2. What is the role of the `currValidators` map in the `Tally` function?
- The `currValidators` map stores the bonded validators and their information, which is used to calculate the voting power of each validator.

3. What are the conditions for a proposal to pass or fail in the `Tally` function?
- If there are no staked coins, the proposal fails. If there is not enough quorum of votes, the proposal fails. If no one votes (everyone abstains), proposal fails. If more than 1/3 of voters veto, proposal fails. If more than 1/2 of non-abstaining voters vote Yes, proposal passes. If more than 1/2 of non-abstaining voters vote No, proposal fails.
