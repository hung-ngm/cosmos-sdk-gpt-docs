The `v4` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code for migrating the store from version 3 to version 4. The `MigrateStore` function is the main function in this package and performs in-place store migrations from version 3 (v0.46) to version 4 (v0.47). The migration includes three main steps:

1. Params migrations from `x/params` to `gov`: This step migrates the deposit, voting, and tally parameters from the `x/params` module to the `gov` module. It retrieves the deposit, voting, and tally parameters from the legacy subspace and creates a new set of parameters using the new `govv1` types. It then marshals the new parameters and sets them in the store.

2. Addition of the new min initial deposit ratio parameter that is set to 0 by default: This step adds a new parameter to the `govv1` types called `MinInitialDepositRatio` and sets its default value to 0. This parameter is used to determine the minimum initial deposit required for a proposal to be submitted.

3. Proposals in voting period are tracked in a separate index: This step creates a new index to track proposals that are in the voting period. It iterates over all proposals in the store and checks if they are in the voting period. If a proposal is in the voting period, it sets a new key in the store to track it.

The `AddProposerAddressToProposal` function is an optional function that adds the proposer to a proposal and sets it in the store. It takes a map of proposal IDs to proposer addresses and iterates over them, checking if the proposer address is valid and if the proposal is active. If the checks pass, it sets the new proposal with the proposer in the store.

Overall, the `v4` package is an important part of the `cosmos-sdk` project as it handles the migration of the store from version 3 to version 4. This package is used in the larger project to ensure that the store is updated correctly when a new version of the `cosmos-sdk` is released.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `migrateParams` function?
- The `migrateParams` function is used to migrate parameter values from the `govv1` module to the `gov` module, and store them in the key-value store.

2. What is the purpose of the `AddProposerAddressToProposal` function?
- The `AddProposerAddressToProposal` function is used to add a proposer to a proposal and store it in the key-value store. This function is optional.

3. What is the overall purpose of the `MigrateStore` function?
- The `MigrateStore` function performs in-place store migrations from v3 to v4, including migrating parameter values and tracking proposals in voting period in a separate index.
