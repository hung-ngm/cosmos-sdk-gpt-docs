The `MigrateStore` function in the `v2` package of the `cosmos-sdk` project is responsible for performing in-place store migrations from version 1 (v0.40) to version 2 (v0.43). The migration includes two main tasks: changing addresses to be length-prefixed and changing all legacy votes to ADR-037 weighted votes.

The `migratePrefixProposalAddress` function is a helper function that migrates all keys of the format `<prefix_bytes><proposal_id (8 bytes)><address_bytes>` into the format `<prefix_bytes><proposal_id (8 bytes)><address_len (1 byte)><address_bytes>`. This function takes a key-value store and a prefix byte array as input. It creates a new store with the given prefix and iterates over the old store to migrate all keys to the new format. The new key is created by appending the prefix, proposal ID, and length-prefixed address. The value of the new key is set to the value of the old key, and the old key is deleted.

The `migrateVote` function migrates a legacy vote to an ADR-037 weighted vote. It takes an old vote of type `v1beta1.Vote` as input and returns a new vote of the same type. The new vote has its `Options` field set to a non-split vote option created from the `Option` field of the old vote.

The `migrateStoreWeightedVotes` function migrates all legacy votes to ADR-037 weighted votes. It takes a key-value store and a binary codec as input. It iterates over all votes in the store and unmarshals each vote using the codec. It then migrates the old vote to a new vote using the `migrateVote` function and marshals the new vote using the codec. The new vote is then set in the store with the same key as the old vote.

Finally, the `MigrateStore` function takes a context, a store key, and a binary codec as input. It gets the key-value store from the context and performs the two migration tasks using the helper functions. It first migrates all deposit keys and then all vote keys. It then migrates all legacy votes to ADR-037 weighted votes using the `migrateStoreWeightedVotes` function. If any error occurs during the migration, it is returned.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `migratePrefixProposalAddress` function?
- The `migratePrefixProposalAddress` function is a helper function that migrates keys in a specific format to a new format by adding a length prefix to the address bytes.

2. What is the purpose of the `migrateVote` function?
- The `migrateVote` function migrates a legacy vote to a new format by changing the `Option` field to the `Options` field.

3. What does the `MigrateStore` function do?
- The `MigrateStore` function performs in-place store migrations from v1 to v2, which includes changing addresses to be length-prefixed and changing all legacy votes to a new format.
