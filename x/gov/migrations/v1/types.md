The `v1` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to governance. The `keys.go` file in this package defines various keys used to store proposals, deposits, and votes in the governance store. It also provides functions to split these keys and retrieve the relevant information.

The file starts by defining constants for the module name, store key, router key, and querier route. It then defines key prefixes for proposals, active and inactive proposal queues, deposits, and votes. These prefixes are used to construct the keys for storing and retrieving data from the governance store.

The file also provides functions to convert proposal IDs to and from byte arrays, as well as functions to construct keys for specific proposals, active and inactive proposal queues, deposits, and votes. These functions are used to store and retrieve data from the governance store.

Finally, the file provides private functions to split keys into their constituent parts. These functions are used by iterators to retrieve specific data from the governance store.

Overall, this file provides the necessary keys and functions to store and retrieve governance-related data in the `cosmos-sdk` project. For example, the `ProposalKey` function can be used to retrieve a specific proposal from the store, while the `SplitKeyVote` function can be used to split a vote key and retrieve the proposal ID and voter address.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this package and what does it do?
- This package is for the governance module of the cosmos-sdk and contains keys for the governance store.

2. What are the different types of keys used in this package and what do they represent?
- There are several types of keys used in this package, including proposal keys, active and inactive proposal queue keys, deposit keys, and vote keys. They represent different items stored in the governance store.

3. What are the functions used to split the keys and what do they do?
- There are four functions used to split the keys: SplitProposalKey, SplitActiveProposalQueueKey, SplitInactiveProposalQueueKey, and SplitKeyDeposit. They split the keys and return the proposal ID, end time, depositor address, or voter address.
