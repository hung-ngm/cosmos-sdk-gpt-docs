The `gov` package contains the implementation of the governance module for the Cosmos SDK. This module allows token holders to submit proposals, vote on them, and fund them with deposits. This file contains two functions: `InitGenesis` and `ExportGenesis`.

`InitGenesis` is called when the blockchain is initialized with a new genesis file. It takes in a `sdk.Context`, `types.AccountKeeper`, `types.BankKeeper`, `keeper.Keeper`, and a `v1.GenesisState`. The function sets the initial state of the governance module by storing the starting proposal ID, governance parameters, and the constitution. It also checks if the governance account exists and sets it if it doesn't. The function then iterates through the deposits, votes, and proposals in the `GenesisState` and sets them in the keeper. Finally, it checks if the total deposits equal the balance of the governance account and panics if they don't.

`ExportGenesis` is called when the blockchain state needs to be exported to a new genesis file. It takes in a `sdk.Context` and a `keeper.Keeper`. The function retrieves the starting proposal ID, proposals, constitution, and parameters from the keeper. It then iterates through the proposals and retrieves their deposits and votes. The function returns a `v1.GenesisState` containing the retrieved data.

These functions are important for initializing and exporting the governance module's state. They allow the governance module to be restarted with the same state or to be migrated to a new blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `gov` package and what does it contain?
- The `gov` package contains code related to governance functionality in the Cosmos SDK, such as proposals, voting, and deposits.
2. What is the significance of the `InitGenesis` function and what does it do?
- The `InitGenesis` function is responsible for storing the initial state of the `gov` module when the blockchain is first created. It sets various parameters, such as the starting proposal ID and the constitution, and checks if the deposits pool account exists.
3. What is the purpose of the `ExportGenesis` function and what does it do?
- The `ExportGenesis` function is responsible for exporting the current state of the `gov` module to be included in the blockchain's genesis file. It retrieves various parameters and data, such as proposals, deposits, and votes, and returns them as a `GenesisState` object.
