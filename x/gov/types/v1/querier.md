This file contains various query parameters and their corresponding structs for the governance module in the Cosmos SDK. The governance module allows token holders to submit proposals and vote on them. The purpose of this file is to define the query parameters that can be used to retrieve information about proposals, votes, and deposits.

The file defines constants for the different query endpoints that are supported by the governance Querier. These endpoints include QueryParams, QueryProposals, QueryProposal, QueryDeposits, QueryDeposit, QueryVotes, and QueryTally. These endpoints can be used to retrieve information about the governance module, such as the parameters, proposals, deposits, votes, and tally.

The file also defines various structs that are used to query the different endpoints. For example, QueryProposalParams is used for queries related to a specific proposal, such as 'custom/gov/proposal'. QueryProposalVotesParams is used to query 'custom/gov/votes', and QueryDepositParams is used to query 'custom/gov/deposit'. Each struct contains the necessary parameters to retrieve the desired information.

The file also includes functions to create new instances of each struct. For example, NewQueryProposalParams creates a new instance of QueryProposalParams with the given proposal ID. Similarly, NewQueryProposalsParams creates a new instance of QueryProposalsParams with the given page, limit, status, voter, and depositor.

Overall, this file provides the necessary query parameters and structs to retrieve information about the governance module in the Cosmos SDK. Developers can use these parameters and structs to build applications that interact with the governance module, such as a voting dashboard or a proposal explorer.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines constants and structs used for querying governance proposals, deposits, votes, and tallying in the cosmos-sdk.

2. What is the difference between QueryProposalParams and QueryProposalVotesParams?
- QueryProposalParams is used for queries related to a specific proposal, while QueryProposalVotesParams is used to query votes related to a specific proposal.

3. What is the purpose of the NewQueryProposalsParams function?
- The NewQueryProposalsParams function creates a new instance of QueryProposalsParams, which is used to query proposals based on page, limit, voter, depositor, and proposal status.
