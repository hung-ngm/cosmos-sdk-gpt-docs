The `ProposalMetadata` struct is a data structure that represents the metadata of a proposal in the cosmos-sdk project. This metadata is intended to be stored off-chain when submitted as part of a proposal. 

The struct contains several fields that provide information about the proposal. The `Title` field is a string that represents the title of the proposal. The `Authors` field is a slice of strings that contains the names of the authors of the proposal. The `Summary` field is a string that provides a brief summary of the proposal. The `Details` field is a string that provides more detailed information about the proposal. The `ProposalForumUrl` field is a string that represents the URL of the forum where the proposal was discussed. Finally, the `VoteOptionContext` field is a string that provides context for the vote options that are available for the proposal.

This struct is likely used in conjunction with other types and functions in the cosmos-sdk project to manage proposals. For example, there may be a function that takes a `ProposalMetadata` struct as an argument and creates a new proposal with that metadata. Alternatively, there may be a function that retrieves the metadata for a given proposal and returns it as a `ProposalMetadata` struct.

Here is an example of how the `ProposalMetadata` struct might be used in the context of the cosmos-sdk project:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new proposal metadata struct
	proposalMetadata := types.ProposalMetadata{
		Title:             "Example Proposal",
		Authors:           []string{"Alice", "Bob"},
		Summary:           "This is an example proposal.",
		Details:           "Here are the details of the proposal...",
		ProposalForumUrl:  "https://example.com/proposal",
		VoteOptionContext: "Please select one of the following options:",
	}

	// Print out the title of the proposal
	fmt.Println(proposalMetadata.Title)
}
``` 

This code creates a new `ProposalMetadata` struct with some example values and then prints out the title of the proposal. In a real-world scenario, this struct would likely be used in a more complex function that creates or retrieves proposals.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProposalMetadata` struct?
- The `ProposalMetadata` struct represents the metadata of a proposal and is intended to be stored off-chain when submitted in a proposal.

2. What fields are included in the `ProposalMetadata` struct?
- The `ProposalMetadata` struct includes fields for the proposal's title, authors, summary, details, proposal forum URL, and vote option context.

3. Why is the `ProposalForumUrl` field named with a lowercase 'u' instead of 'URL'?
- The `ProposalForumUrl` field is named with a lowercase 'u' instead of 'URL' to avoid the camel case split, as indicated by the `nolint:revive` comment.
