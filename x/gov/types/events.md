This file defines constants for event types and attribute keys related to the governance module in the cosmos-sdk project. The governance module allows stakeholders to submit proposals for changes to the network and vote on them. 

The `EventType` constants define the different types of events that can occur during the proposal process, such as submitting a proposal, depositing funds to a proposal, voting on a proposal, and cancelling a proposal. These event types can be used to track and analyze the proposal process in the network.

The `AttributeKey` constants define the different attributes that can be associated with a proposal, such as the result of the proposal, the option being voted on, the ID of the proposal, the messages included in the proposal, the start of the voting period, and the log of the proposal execution. These attributes can be used to provide additional information about the proposal and its outcome.

The `AttributeValue` constants define the different possible values for the result of a proposal, such as whether it passed or failed, whether it was dropped due to not meeting the minimum deposit requirement, or whether it was cancelled due to an error in the proposal handler. These values can be used to determine the outcome of a proposal and take appropriate action based on that outcome.

Overall, this file provides a standardized set of constants for tracking and analyzing the governance module in the cosmos-sdk project. These constants can be used throughout the project to provide consistent and reliable information about the proposal process. 

Example usage:

```go
import "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/gov/types"

// Log the result of a proposal
func logProposalResult(result string) {
    attributes := []sdk.Attribute{
        {Key: types.AttributeKeyProposalResult, Value: result},
    }
    ctx.EventManager().EmitEvent(sdk.NewEvent(types.EventTypeSubmitProposal, attributes))
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this file?
- This file defines constants for event types and attribute keys related to the governance module in the cosmos-sdk project.

2. What are some examples of events that can be triggered in the governance module?
- Examples of events include submitting a proposal, depositing on a proposal, voting on a proposal, and canceling a proposal.

3. What is the significance of the different attribute values for a proposal, such as "proposal_passed" and "proposal_failed"?
- These attribute values represent the outcome of a proposal, such as whether it passed or failed, or if it was dropped due to not meeting the minimum deposit requirement.
