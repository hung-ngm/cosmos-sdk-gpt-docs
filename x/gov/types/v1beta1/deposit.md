This file contains code related to deposits in the cosmos-sdk project. Specifically, it defines a Deposit struct, a Deposits collection, and several methods related to these types.

The Deposit struct has three fields: proposalID (an unsigned 64-bit integer), depositor (an account address), and amount (a collection of coins). The NewDeposit function is a constructor for this struct, which takes these three fields as arguments and returns a new Deposit instance.

The Empty method is a receiver function for the Deposit struct, which returns true if the deposit is empty (i.e. if its string representation is equal to that of a new, empty Deposit instance).

The Deposits type is a slice of Deposit objects. The Equal method is a receiver function for this type, which returns true if two slices of deposits are equal (i.e. if they have the same length and contain the same deposits in the same order). The String method is also a receiver function for Deposits, which returns a string representation of the deposits in the slice.

Overall, this code provides a way to create and manipulate deposits in the cosmos-sdk project. For example, the NewDeposit function can be used to create a new deposit, and the Equal and String methods can be used to compare and display collections of deposits, respectively.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NewDeposit` function?
- The `NewDeposit` function creates a new instance of the `Deposit` struct with the given `proposalID`, `depositor` address, and `amount` of coins.

2. What is the purpose of the `Equal` method on the `Deposits` type?
- The `Equal` method compares two slices of `Deposit` objects and returns true if they are equal (i.e. have the same length and contain the same deposits in the same order).

3. What is the purpose of the `String` method on the `Deposits` type?
- The `String` method returns a string representation of the `Deposits` slice, showing the proposal ID and each deposit's depositor address and amount of coins.
