This file contains constants, structs, and functions related to querying the governance module in the Cosmos SDK. The governance module allows token holders to submit proposals and vote on them, with the outcome determined by a tally of votes. 

The file defines constants for the various query endpoints supported by the governance Querier, including QueryParams, QueryProposals, QueryProposal, QueryDeposits, QueryDeposit, QueryVotes, and QueryTally. These endpoints can be used to retrieve information about the governance module, such as the current parameters, all proposals, a specific proposal, all deposits for a proposal, all votes for a proposal, and the tally for a proposal.

The file also defines several structs for the parameters of these queries, including QueryProposalParams, QueryProposalVotesParams, QueryDepositParams, QueryVoteParams, and QueryProposalsParams. These structs contain fields such as the proposal ID, depositor address, voter address, and page and limit for pagination.

Finally, the file defines several functions for creating instances of these query parameter structs, including NewQueryProposalParams, NewQueryProposalVotesParams, NewQueryDepositParams, NewQueryVoteParams, and NewQueryProposalsParams. These functions take in the necessary parameters and return a new instance of the corresponding struct.

Overall, this file provides a standardized way to query the governance module in the Cosmos SDK, making it easier for developers to build applications that interact with this module. For example, a developer building a governance dashboard could use these query endpoints and parameter structs to retrieve and display information about proposals, votes, and deposits.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines constants and structs for query parameters related to governance in the cosmos-sdk.

2. What are the different types of query endpoints supported by the governance Querier?
- The different types of query endpoints supported by the governance Querier are QueryParams, QueryProposals, QueryProposal, QueryDeposits, QueryDeposit, QueryVotes, and QueryTally.

3. What is the purpose of the NewQueryProposalsParams function?
- The NewQueryProposalsParams function creates a new instance of QueryProposalsParams, which is a struct that contains parameters for querying proposals related to governance in the cosmos-sdk.
