The `cli` package contains the command-line interface (CLI) for the Cosmos SDK. This file contains the implementation of the `draft-proposal` command, which generates a draft proposal JSON file. The generated proposal JSON contains only one message (skeleton).

The `Prompt` function prompts the user for all values of the given type. It takes a struct and a name prefix as input and returns the filled struct and an error. The function iterates over the struct's fields and creates prompts for each field. It validates the input based on the field name and type and sets the field value accordingly.

The `proposalType` struct defines a proposal type with a name, message type, and message. The `Prompt` method of the `proposalType` struct prompts the user for the proposal type values and returns the proposal and its metadata. It sets the metadata, deposit, and messages fields of the proposal based on the user input.

The `getProposalSuggestions` function returns a list of proposal types.

The `NewCmdDraftProposal` function creates a new `draft-proposal` command. It prompts the user for the proposal type and generates a draft proposal JSON file based on the user input. It uses the `Prompt` and `proposalType.Prompt` functions to prompt the user for the proposal values. It also uses the `writeFile` function to write the generated proposal and metadata to files.

The `writeFile` function writes the input to a file. It takes a file name and input as input and returns an error. It marshals the input to JSON and writes it to the file.

Overall, this file provides the functionality to generate a draft proposal JSON file with a single message based on user input. This command is useful for users who want to create a proposal but are not familiar with the proposal format.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Prompt` function?
- The `Prompt` function prompts the user for input values of a given type and returns the filled struct and any error encountered during the process.

2. What is the purpose of the `NewCmdDraftProposal` function?
- The `NewCmdDraftProposal` function generates a draft proposal JSON file containing only one message (skeleton) and prompts the user for the proposal type, deposit, and message type.

3. What is the purpose of the `writeFile` function?
- The `writeFile` function writes the input to a file with the given file name and returns any error encountered during the process. In this case, it is used to write the generated draft proposal and metadata to separate JSON files.
