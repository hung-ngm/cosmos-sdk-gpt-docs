The `cli` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code for the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cosmos SDK. This file contains functions and types related to submitting governance proposals through the CLI.

The `legacyProposal` type represents a proposal in the old format, which is a plain JSON object with fields for title, description, type, and deposit. The `validate` method checks that the required fields are present. The `parseSubmitLegacyProposal` function reads the proposal from the command-line flags or a file, validates it, and returns it as a `legacyProposal` object.

The `proposal` type represents a proposal in the new format, which is a JSON object with fields for messages, metadata, deposit, title, summary, and expedited. The `parseSubmitProposal` function reads the proposal from a file, unmarshals it into a `proposal` object, unmarshals the messages into an array of `sdk.Msg` objects, parses the deposit into `sdk.Coins`, and returns all of these values.

The `AddGovPropFlagsToCmd` function adds command-line flags to a `cobra.Command` object for defining the fields of a `govv1.MsgSubmitProposal` object, which is the new format for submitting proposals. The `ReadGovPropFlags` function reads the flags from a `pflag.FlagSet` object, creates a `govv1.MsgSubmitProposal` object, sets its fields from the flags, and returns it.

These functions and types are used by the `gov` package in the `x` directory of the Cosmos SDK, which implements the governance module. The governance module allows token holders to submit proposals and vote on them. The CLI functions in this file allow users to submit proposals from the command line, using either the old or new format. The `AddGovPropFlagsToCmd` and `ReadGovPropFlags` functions are specifically used to add flags for the `MsgSubmitProposal` message and read them from the command line.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this file?
- This file contains code related to submitting and parsing governance proposals in the cosmos-sdk.

2. What is the difference between `legacyProposal` and `proposal`?
- `legacyProposal` is an older type of proposal that is being phased out, while `proposal` is a newer Msg-based proposal.
- `legacyProposal` has a simpler structure and requires fewer fields to be filled out.

3. What is the purpose of `AddGovPropFlagsToCmd` and `ReadGovPropFlags`?
- `AddGovPropFlagsToCmd` adds flags to a `cobra.Command` that allow the user to define fields for a `MsgSubmitProposal`.
- `ReadGovPropFlags` parses the flags set by `AddGovPropFlagsToCmd` and returns a `govv1.MsgSubmitProposal` object that can be used to submit a proposal.
