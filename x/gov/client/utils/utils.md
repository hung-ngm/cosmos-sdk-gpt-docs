The `utils` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains several utility functions that are used throughout the project. This file in particular contains functions that normalize user input for various parameters related to governance proposals.

The `NormalizeVoteOption` function takes a string input representing a user's vote option and returns the corresponding string representation of the vote option as defined in the `v1beta1` package. For example, if the input is "Yes" or "yes", the function returns the string "YES". This function is useful for ensuring that user input is consistent and can be properly processed by other parts of the system.

The `NormalizeWeightedVoteOptions` function takes a string input representing a comma-separated list of vote options and their corresponding weights, and returns a normalized string representation of the options. The function first splits the input string into individual options, then normalizes each option using the `NormalizeVoteOption` function. If a weight is not specified for an option, the function defaults to a weight of 1. The normalized options are then joined back together into a comma-separated string. This function is used to ensure that vote options are properly formatted and can be processed by the governance module.

The `NormalizeProposalType` function takes a string input representing a user's proposal type and returns the corresponding string representation of the proposal type as defined in the `v1beta1` package. Currently, the only supported proposal type is "Text", so the function simply returns that string if the input is "Text" or "text". This function is useful for ensuring that user input is consistent and can be properly processed by other parts of the system.

The `NormalizeProposalStatus` function takes a string input representing a user's proposal status and returns the corresponding string representation of the proposal status as defined in the `v1beta1` package. The function supports four possible status values: "DepositPeriod", "VotingPeriod", "Passed", and "Rejected". If the input matches one of these values, the function returns the corresponding string representation. Otherwise, the function simply returns the input string. This function is useful for ensuring that user input is consistent and can be properly processed by other parts of the system.

Overall, these functions are important for ensuring that user input related to governance proposals is properly formatted and can be processed by other parts of the system. They are used throughout the `cosmos-sdk` project to normalize user input and ensure consistency across the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains functions for normalizing user-specified vote options, proposal types, and proposal statuses.

2. What is the significance of the `v1beta1` package imported in this file?
- The `v1beta1` package contains types related to governance proposals in the Cosmos SDK.

3. What is the expected input and output format for the `NormalizeWeightedVoteOptions` function?
- The `NormalizeWeightedVoteOptions` function takes a string of comma-separated vote options in the format `option1=weight1,option2=weight2,...` and returns a normalized string in the same format with vote option names converted to their canonical form.
