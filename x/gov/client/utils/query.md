The `utils` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains a set of utility functions and types that are used across the project. The code in this file provides functions for querying and retrieving information about governance proposals and votes.

The `QueryVotesByTxQuery` function queries for votes on a proposal using a direct txs tags query. It fetches and builds votes directly from the returned txs and returns a JSON marshaled result or any error that occurred. The function takes a `client.Context` and a `v1.QueryProposalVotesParams` as input and returns a byte slice and an error. The `QueryProposalVotesParams` struct contains the proposal ID, page number, and limit for the query. The function searches for both legacy votes and weighted votes and returns the results in a paginated format.

The `QueryVoteByTxQuery` function queries for a single vote on a proposal using a direct txs tags query. It takes a `client.Context` and a `v1.QueryVoteParams` as input and returns a byte slice and an error. The `QueryVoteParams` struct contains the proposal ID, voter address, page number, and limit for the query. The function searches for the vote using the proposal ID and voter address and returns the result in a JSON marshaled format.

The `QueryProposerByTxQuery` function queries for the proposer of a governance proposal by ID. It takes a `client.Context` and a proposal ID as input and returns a `Proposer` struct and an error. The `Proposer` struct contains the proposal ID and proposer address. The function searches for the proposer using the proposal ID and returns the result in a `Proposer` struct.

The `NewProposer` function returns a new `Proposer` struct given an ID and proposer address. The `Proposer` struct contains metadata of a governance proposal used for querying a proposer.

The `convertVote` function converts a `v1beta1.MsgVoteWeighted` into a `*v1.Vote`. It takes a `v1beta1.MsgVoteWeighted` as input and returns a `*v1.Vote`. The function is used to convert a weighted vote into a standard vote.

Overall, these functions provide a set of utility functions for querying and retrieving information about governance proposals and votes in the `cosmos-sdk` project. They can be used by other modules in the project to implement governance-related functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `QueryVotesByTxQuery` function?
- The `QueryVotesByTxQuery` function is used to query for votes via a direct txs tags query, fetch and build votes directly from the returned txs, and return a JSON marshaled result or any error that occurred.

2. What is the difference between `v1` and `v1beta1` packages?
- The `v1` and `v1beta1` packages are different versions of the `gov` package. `v1` is the current version, while `v1beta1` is a previous version.

3. What is the purpose of the `convertVote` function?
- The `convertVote` function is used to convert a `MsgVoteWeighted` into a `*v1.Vote`.
