This file contains the implementation of the `nft.QueryServer` interface for the `Keeper` struct. The `Keeper` struct is responsible for managing the state of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the Cosmos SDK blockchain framework. 

The `nft.QueryServer` interface defines the methods that can be used to query the state of NFTs. The methods implemented in this file include `Balance`, `Owner`, `Supply`, `NFTs`, `NFT`, `Class`, and `Classes`. 

The `Balance` method returns the number of NFTs of a given class owned by a specific owner. The `Owner` method returns the owner of a specific NFT based on its class and ID. The `Supply` method returns the total number of NFTs from a given class. The `NFTs` method returns all NFTs of a given class or owner. The `NFT` method returns a specific NFT based on its class and ID. The `Class` method returns an NFT class based on its ID. The `Classes` method returns all NFT classes.

These methods are used to query the state of NFTs in the Cosmos SDK blockchain framework. For example, a user may want to query the number of NFTs they own or the total number of NFTs in a specific class. These methods provide a way to do so. 

Here is an example of how the `Balance` method can be used:

```
import (
    "context"
    "cosmossdk.io/x/nft"
)

func getNFTBalance(ctx context.Context, classID string, owner string) (uint64, error) {
    client := nft.NewQueryClient(ctx)
    req := &nft.QueryBalanceRequest{
        ClassId: classID,
        Owner:   owner,
    }
    res, err := client.Balance(ctx, req)
    if err != nil {
        return 0, err
    }
    return res.Amount, nil
}
```

This function queries the balance of NFTs of a specific class owned by a specific owner. It uses the `nft.QueryClient` to call the `Balance` method implemented in this file. The result is returned as a `uint64`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of various query functions for NFTs (non-fungible tokens) in the cosmos-sdk project.

2. What are the input parameters and expected output for the `Balance` function?
- The `Balance` function takes a context and a `QueryBalanceRequest` struct as input, and returns a `QueryBalanceResponse` struct and an error as output. The `QueryBalanceRequest` struct contains the class ID and owner address for which the balance needs to be returned, and the `QueryBalanceResponse` struct contains the balance amount.

3. What is the purpose of the `Classes` function?
- The `Classes` function returns all NFT classes in the system, and takes a context and a `QueryClassesRequest` struct as input, and returns a `QueryClassesResponse` struct and an error as output. The `QueryClassesResponse` struct contains a list of all NFT classes and a pagination object.
