The `simulation` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project implements a full-fledged application for executing simulation test suites. The `SimApp` type defines an application used for running extensive simulation testing suites. It contains all core modules, including governance, staking, slashing, and distribution. 

Simulation is executed with various inputs including the number of blocks to simulate, the block size, whether the app should commit or not, the invariant checking period, and a seed which is used as a source of pseudo-randomness. In addition to the various inputs, simulation runs mainly in three modes:

1. Completely random where the initial state, module parameters, and simulation parameters are pseudo-randomly generated.
2. From a genesis file where the initial state and the module parameters are defined. This mode is helpful for running simulations on a known state such as a live network export where a new (mostly likely breaking) version of the application needs to be tested.
3. From a params file where the initial state is pseudo-randomly generated but the module and simulation parameters can be provided manually. This allows for a more controlled and deterministic simulation setup while allowing the state space to still be pseudo-randomly simulated.

The simulation test suite also supports testing determinism and import/export functionality. Currently, simulation uses a single seed (integer) as a source for a PRNG by which all random operations are executed from. Any call to the PRNG changes all future operations as the internal state of the PRNG is modified. In the future, the simulation suite is expected to support a series of PRNGs that can be used uniquely per module and simulation component so that they will not affect each other's state execution outcome.

The package provides various usage examples for executing simulations with different inputs and modes. The package also supports exporting the simulation params to a file at a given block height and exporting the simulation app state (i.e., genesis) to a file. Params that are provided to simulation from a JSON file are used to set both module parameters and simulation parameters. See `sim_test.go` for the full set of parameters that can be provided.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the simulation test suites in this project?
- The simulation test suites are used for executing extensive simulation testing in the Cosmos SDK application.

2. How does the simulation handle randomness and what are the potential issues with this approach?
- The simulation currently uses a single seed as a source for a PRNG, which can be problematic when testing fixes to simulation faults. In the future, the simulation suite is expected to support a series of PRNGs that can be used uniquely per module and simulation component so that they will not affect each other's state execution outcome.

3. What are the different modes in which the simulation can be run and how are they useful?
- The simulation can be run in three modes: completely random, from a genesis file, and from a params file. The genesis file mode is helpful for running simulations on a known state such as a live network export where a new version of the application needs to be tested, while the params file mode allows for a more controlled and deterministic simulation setup while still allowing the state space to be pseudo-randomly simulated.
