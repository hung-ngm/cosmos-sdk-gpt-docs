The `simulation` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides tools for simulating the behavior of the blockchain network. This file contains functions for generating and delivering transactions during the simulation.

The `getTestingMode` function determines whether the code is being run in testing mode or benchmarking mode. It returns a boolean value indicating the mode and a reference to the testing object.

The `getBlockSize` function returns a block size based on a transition matrix. The function takes a random number generator, a set of parameters, the last block size state, and the average block size as input. It returns the new block size state and the new block size. The function uses a transition matrix to determine the new block size state. The transition matrix has three states: "overstuffed" blocks with an average size of 2 * avgblocksize, normal sized blocks hitting avgBlocksize on average, and empty blocks with no transactions or only transactions scheduled from the past.

The `mustMarshalJSONIndent` function marshals an object to JSON with indentation. If the marshaling fails, the function panics.

The `OperationInput` struct holds all the values needed to generate and deliver a transaction. The struct contains a random number generator, a reference to the base application, a transaction configuration, a codec, a message, the coins spent in the message, a context, a simulated account, an account keeper, a bank keeper, and a module name.

The `GenAndDeliverTxWithRandFees` function generates a transaction with a random fee and delivers it. The function takes an `OperationInput` struct as input and returns an `OperationMsg`, a slice of `FutureOperation`s, and an error. The function gets the account associated with the simulated account, calculates the spendable coins, and generates random fees. If the message doesn't leave room for fees, the function returns a `NoOpMsg`. Otherwise, the function calls `GenAndDeliverTx` with the fees.

The `GenAndDeliverTx` function generates a transaction and delivers it. The function takes an `OperationInput` struct and fees as input and returns an `OperationMsg`, a slice of `FutureOperation`s, and an error. The function gets the account associated with the simulated account and generates a signed mock transaction. The function then delivers the transaction using the `SimDeliver` function of the base application. Finally, the function returns an `OperationMsg` with the message, a boolean indicating success, an empty string, and the codec.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `getBlockSize` function?
- The `getBlockSize` function returns a block size based on a transition matrix, with the goal of making the average block size equal to a provided parameter. It moves between three states: "over stuffed" blocks, normal sized blocks, and empty blocks.

2. What is the purpose of the `OperationInput` struct?
- The `OperationInput` struct holds all the necessary values to generate and deliver a transaction, including a random number generator, the application, a transaction configuration, a codec, a message, coins spent in the message, a context, a simulated account, and keepers for accounts and banks.

3. What is the difference between `GenAndDeliverTxWithRandFees` and `GenAndDeliverTx`?
- `GenAndDeliverTxWithRandFees` generates a transaction with a random fee and delivers it, while `GenAndDeliverTx` generates a transaction with a provided fee and delivers it. Both functions return an operation message, future operations, and an error.
