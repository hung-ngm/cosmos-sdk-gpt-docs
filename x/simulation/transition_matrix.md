The `simulation` package contains code for simulating the behavior of the Cosmos SDK blockchain. The `TransitionMatrix` struct represents a transition matrix, which is used to model the probability of transitioning from one state to another in a Markov chain. The `CreateTransitionMatrix` function takes a two-dimensional slice of integers representing the weights of the transition matrix and returns a `TransitionMatrix` struct. The `NextState` method of the `TransitionMatrix` struct takes a random number generator and an integer representing the current state, and returns the next state randomly chosen using the provided weights. The `GetMemberOfInitialState` function takes a random number generator and a one-dimensional slice of integers representing the weights of the initial state, and returns a weighted random number in the range [0,n), where n is the length of the weights slice.

This code is used in the larger project to simulate the behavior of the Cosmos SDK blockchain. The transition matrix is used to model the probability of transitioning from one state to another in the blockchain, and the `NextState` method is used to randomly choose the next state based on the current state and the weights of the transition matrix. The `GetMemberOfInitialState` function is used to randomly choose the initial state based on the weights of the initial state. An example usage of the `CreateTransitionMatrix` function might look like this:

```
weights := [][]int{
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9},
}
tm, err := CreateTransitionMatrix(weights)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

This would create a transition matrix with the provided weights and return a `TransitionMatrix` struct. The `NextState` method could then be used to randomly choose the next state based on the current state and the weights of the transition matrix. The `GetMemberOfInitialState` function could be used to randomly choose the initial state based on the weights of the initial state.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TransitionMatrix` struct and how is it used in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `TransitionMatrix` struct is used to represent a transition matrix with weights and totals for each column. It is used to randomly choose the next state in a simulation.

2. What is the purpose of the `CreateTransitionMatrix` function and what are the possible errors that it can return?
- The `CreateTransitionMatrix` function creates a `TransitionMatrix` from the provided weights and totals. It can return an error if the provided matrix is not square.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetMemberOfInitialState` function and how is it used in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `GetMemberOfInitialState` function returns a weighted random number in [0,n) based on the provided weights. It is used to choose the initial state in a simulation.
