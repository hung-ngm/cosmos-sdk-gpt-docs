The `v2` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to authorization and permissions. This specific file defines functions and keys for storing and retrieving authorization grants.

The file defines two prefixes for store keys: `GrantPrefix` and `GrantQueuePrefix`. The `GrantStoreKey` function returns a key for storing a grant authorization. The key is composed of the `GrantPrefix`, the length-prefixed granter and grantee addresses, and the message type. The `ParseGrantKey` function extracts the granter and grantee addresses and message type from a grant authorization key.

The `GrantQueueKey` function returns a key for storing a grant queue item. The key is composed of the `GrantQueuePrefix`, the expiration time, the length-prefixed granter and grantee addresses. 

These functions are used in the larger project to manage authorization grants and grant queues. For example, the `GrantStoreKey` function may be used to store a grant authorization for a specific message type between a granter and grantee. The `ParseGrantKey` function may be used to extract the granter and grantee addresses and message type from a stored grant authorization. The `GrantQueueKey` function may be used to store a grant queue item for a specific expiration time and granter and grantee addresses.

Example usage:

```
// Store a grant authorization for a specific message type between a granter and grantee
grantKey := GrantStoreKey(granteeAddr, granterAddr, "messageType")
store.Set(grantKey, grantValue)

// Retrieve the granter and grantee addresses and message type from a stored grant authorization
granterAddr, granteeAddr, msgType := ParseGrantKey(grantKey)

// Store a grant queue item for a specific expiration time and granter and grantee addresses
queueKey := GrantQueueKey(expirationTime, granterAddr, granteeAddr)
store.Set(queueKey, queueValue)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this package and what does it do?
- This package contains functions for managing grants and authorizations, with keys for store prefixes and functions for creating and parsing grant and queue keys.

2. What is the format of the keys used for storing grants and queue items?
- Grants are stored with the key format `0x01<granterAddressLen (1 Byte)><granterAddress_Bytes><granteeAddressLen (1 Byte)><granteeAddress_Bytes><msgType_Bytes>: Grant`, while queue items are stored with the key format `0x02<grant_expiration_Bytes>: GrantQueueItem`.

3. What are the parameters required for creating a grant queue key?
- A grant queue key requires an expiration time, a granter address, and a grantee address. These parameters are used to create a key with the format `0x02<grant_expiration_Bytes>: GrantQueueItem`.
