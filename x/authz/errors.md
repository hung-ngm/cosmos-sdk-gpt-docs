This code defines a set of sentinel errors for the `authz` module in the `cosmos-sdk` project. Sentinel errors are predefined errors that are used throughout the module to provide consistent error messages and codes. 

The `authz` module is responsible for managing authorizations and permissions within the Cosmos SDK. It allows users to grant and revoke permissions to other users or applications, and to specify conditions under which those permissions are valid. 

The sentinel errors defined in this code are used to handle various error conditions that may arise during the authorization process. For example, `ErrNoAuthorizationFound` is returned if there is no authorization found given a grant key, `ErrInvalidExpirationTime` is returned if the set expiration time is in the past, and `ErrUnknownAuthorizationType` is returned for unknown authorization types. 

These errors are registered with the `errors` package, which is used throughout the Cosmos SDK to provide consistent error handling. By using sentinel errors, the `authz` module can provide detailed error messages and codes that can be easily understood and handled by other parts of the SDK. 

Here is an example of how these errors might be used in the larger project:

```
func GetAuthorization(grantKey string) (*Authorization, error) {
    auth, err := authz.GetAuthorization(grantKey)
    if err != nil {
        if errors.Is(err, authz.ErrNoAuthorizationFound) {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("authorization not found for grant key %s", grantKey)
        }
        return nil, err
    }
    return auth, nil
}
```

In this example, the `GetAuthorization` function attempts to retrieve an authorization using a grant key. If the authorization is not found, it returns a custom error message that includes the grant key. If any other error occurs, it returns the original error. By using the `errors.Is` function to check for the `ErrNoAuthorizationFound` sentinel error, the function can provide a more specific error message for this particular error condition.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `authz` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `authz` package is used for authorization-related functionality in the `cosmos-sdk` project.

2. What is the significance of the `errors.Register` function calls in this code?
- The `errors.Register` function is used to register sentinel errors with a specific module name and code. These sentinel errors can then be used to handle specific errors within the `authz` module.

3. What are some examples of errors that can be thrown by the `authz` module?
- Some examples of errors that can be thrown by the `authz` module include: `ErrNoAuthorizationFound`, `ErrInvalidExpirationTime`, `ErrUnknownAuthorizationType`, `ErrNoGrantKeyFound`, `ErrAuthorizationExpired`, `ErrGranteeIsGranter`, `ErrAuthorizationNumOfSigners`, and `ErrNegativeMaxTokens`.
