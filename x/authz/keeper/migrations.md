The code above is a part of the cosmos-sdk project and is located in the `keeper` package. The purpose of this code is to handle in-place store migrations from version 1 to version 2. 

The `Migrator` struct is defined to handle these migrations and has a single field, `keeper`, which is of type `Keeper`. The `NewMigrator` function returns a new `Migrator` struct with the `keeper` field set to the provided `Keeper` instance. 

The `Migrate1to2` function is used to migrate the store from version 1 to version 2. It takes a `sdk.Context` as an argument and returns an error if the migration fails. The migration is performed by calling the `v2.MigrateStore` function, which is located in the `authz/migrations/v2` package. This function takes three arguments: the `sdk.Context`, the store key, and the codec. The store key and codec are obtained from the `keeper` field of the `Migrator` struct.

This code is used in the larger cosmos-sdk project to handle store migrations when upgrading from version 1 to version 2. The `Migrator` struct and `Migrate1to2` function provide a simple interface for performing this migration, while the `v2.MigrateStore` function handles the actual migration logic. 

Example usage:

```
// create a new Migrator instance
migrator := NewMigrator(keeperInstance)

// perform the migration from version 1 to version 2
err := migrator.Migrate1to2(ctx)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Migrator` struct?
- The `Migrator` struct is used for handling in-place store migrations.

2. What is the role of the `NewMigrator` function?
- The `NewMigrator` function returns a new `Migrator` struct.

3. What does the `Migrate1to2` function do?
- The `Migrate1to2` function migrates from version 1 to 2 by calling the `MigrateStore` function from the `v2` package with the provided context, store key, and codec.
