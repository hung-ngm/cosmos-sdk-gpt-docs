This code defines constants for the `authz` module in the `cosmos-sdk` project. 

The `ModuleName` constant is a string that represents the name of the module. It is used in many places throughout the project to identify the module.

The `RouterKey` constant is a string that represents the message route for the `authz` module. It is used to route messages to the appropriate handler within the module.

The `QuerierRoute` constant is a string that represents the querier route for the `authz` module. It is used to route queries to the appropriate handler within the module.

These constants are important for the functioning of the `authz` module within the larger `cosmos-sdk` project. They allow for messages and queries to be properly routed and handled within the module. 

For example, if a message is sent to the `authz` module, the `RouterKey` constant will be used to determine which handler within the module should handle the message. Similarly, if a query is made to the `authz` module, the `QuerierRoute` constant will be used to determine which handler within the module should handle the query.

Overall, this code is a small but important piece of the `authz` module in the `cosmos-sdk` project. It helps to ensure that messages and queries are properly handled within the module, which is crucial for the functioning of the larger project.
