The `authz` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to authorization and permissions. This specific file contains code related to the `GenesisState` object, which represents the initial state of the authorization module.

The `NewGenesisState` function creates a new `GenesisState` object with the given `entries` of `GrantAuthorization`. This function is likely used during the initialization of the authorization module to set the initial state.

The `ValidateGenesis` function is a placeholder function that currently does not perform any validation. It is likely intended to be used in the future to ensure the integrity of the `GenesisState` object.

The `DefaultGenesisState` function returns a default `GenesisState` object. This function is likely used as a fallback in case the `GenesisState` object is not initialized during module initialization.

The `UnpackInterfaces` function is used to unpack the `Authorization` field of the `GenesisState` object and the `Authorization` field of the `GrantAuthorization` object. This function is used to ensure that the `Authorization` field can be properly encoded and decoded when the `GenesisState` object is stored or retrieved from the database.

Overall, this file provides the basic functionality for creating, validating, and unpacking the `GenesisState` object for the authorization module in the `cosmos-sdk` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `authz` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `authz` package likely contains functionality related to authorization and permissions within the Cosmos SDK.

2. What is the `GenesisState` object and how is it used in this code?
- The `GenesisState` object appears to be a data structure used to represent the initial state of the system. In this code, it is used to create a new `GenesisState` object, validate a `GenesisState` object, and define a default `GenesisState` object.

3. What is the purpose of the `UnpackInterfaces` method in this code?
- The `UnpackInterfaces` method is used to unpack any interface values contained within the `GenesisState` and `GrantAuthorization` objects. This is likely necessary for serialization and deserialization purposes.
