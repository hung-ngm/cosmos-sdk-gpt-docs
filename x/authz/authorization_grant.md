The `authz` package contains code related to authorization and permissions in the Cosmos SDK. The file contains three functions and a struct.

The `NewGrant` function returns a new `Grant` struct. The function takes three arguments: `blockTime`, `a`, and `expiration`. `blockTime` is the current block time, `a` is an `Authorization` interface, and `expiration` is an optional expiration time. The function returns an error if the expiration time is before the current block time. The function then converts the `Authorization` interface to a protobuf message and creates a new `Grant` struct with the `Authorization` and `expiration` fields.

The `UnpackInterfaces` function is used to unpack the `Authorization` field of the `Grant` struct. It implements the `cdctypes.UnpackInterfacesMessage` interface. The function takes an `unpacker` argument and returns an error. The function unpacks the `Authorization` field using the `unpacker` and sets the result to the `authorization` variable.

The `GetAuthorization` function returns the cached value of the `Authorization` field of the `Grant` struct. The function returns an error if the `Authorization` field is nil. The function then gets the cached value of the `Authorization` field and returns it as an `Authorization` interface.

The `ValidateBasic` function validates the `Authorization` field of the `Grant` struct. The function returns an error if the `Authorization` field is nil or if the cached value of the `Authorization` field is not an `Authorization` interface. The function then calls the `ValidateBasic` function of the `Authorization` interface and returns its result.

Overall, this file provides functionality related to creating, unpacking, and validating `Grant` structs. These structs are used to represent authorization grants in the Cosmos SDK. The `NewGrant` function is used to create new `Grant` structs, while the `UnpackInterfaces` function is used to unpack the `Authorization` field of a `Grant` struct. The `GetAuthorization` function is used to retrieve the cached value of the `Authorization` field, and the `ValidateBasic` function is used to validate the `Authorization` field of a `Grant` struct.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NewGrant` function and what are the arguments it takes?
- The `NewGrant` function returns a new `Grant` and takes in the current block time, an `Authorization` interface, and an optional expiration time.
2. What is the purpose of the `UnpackInterfaces` method and what does it do?
- The `UnpackInterfaces` method is used to unpack the `Authorization` interface from the `Grant` struct using the `cdctypes.AnyUnpacker` interface.
3. What is the purpose of the `ValidateBasic` method and what does it do?
- The `ValidateBasic` method is used to validate the `Authorization` interface from the `Grant` struct by calling its own `ValidateBasic` method.
