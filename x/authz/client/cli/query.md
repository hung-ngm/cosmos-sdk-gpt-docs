The code is a part of the cosmos-sdk project and is located in the cli package. The purpose of this code is to provide the cli query commands for the authz (authorization) module. The code defines three functions that return the cli commands for querying authorization grants. These functions are GetCmdQueryGrants, GetQueryGranterGrants, and GetQueryGranteeGrants. 

The GetCmdQueryGrants function implements the query authorization command. It takes an address codec as an argument and returns a cobra command. The command can be used to query authorization grants for a granter-grantee pair and optionally a message type URL. The function reads the command-line arguments, validates them, and sends a query to the authz module. The response is printed to the console. 

The GetQueryGranterGrants function returns a cobra command that can be used to query all grants for a granter. The function takes an address codec as an argument and reads the command-line arguments to send a query to the authz module. The response is printed to the console. 

The GetQueryGranteeGrants function returns a cobra command that can be used to query all grants for a grantee. The function takes an address codec as an argument and reads the command-line arguments to send a query to the authz module. The response is printed to the console. 

These functions can be used in the larger project to provide the cli query commands for the authz module. The authz module is responsible for managing authorization grants for different message types. The cli query commands provided by this code can be used to query these grants. The response can be used to determine if a granter has granted access to a grantee for a specific message type. 

Example usage of the cli query command for querying grants for a granter-grantee pair and a message type URL:
```
$ cosmos-sdk query authz grants cosmos1skj.. cosmos1skjwj.. bank/Send
```

Example usage of the cli query command for querying all grants for a granter:
```
$ cosmos-sdk query authz grants-by-granter cosmos1skj..
```

Example usage of the cli query command for querying all grants for a grantee:
```
$ cosmos-sdk query authz grants-by-grantee cosmos1skj..
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains functions that return Cobra commands for querying authorization grants for the authz module.

2. What dependencies are imported in this file?
- This file imports several packages including `fmt`, `strings`, `cosmossdk.io/core/address`, `github.com/spf13/cobra`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/client`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/client/flags`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/version`, and `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/authz`.

3. What is the format of the command to query grants for a granter-grantee pair?
- The format of the command is `cosmos-sdk query authz grants [granter-addr] [grantee-addr] [msg-type-url]?`. The `msg-type-url` is optional and if set, it will select grants only for that message type.
