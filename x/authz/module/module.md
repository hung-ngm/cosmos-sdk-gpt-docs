The `authz` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides authorization functionality for Cosmos SDK applications. This package contains the implementation of the `AppModuleBasic` and `AppModule` structs, which are used to define the basic application module and the main application module, respectively.

The `AppModuleBasic` struct defines the basic application module used by the `authz` module. It implements the `module.AppModuleBasic` interface and provides methods for registering services, codecs, and interfaces, as well as for returning the module's name, default genesis state, and validation of the genesis state. It also provides methods for registering gRPC Gateway routes and for returning the query and transaction commands for the module.

The `AppModule` struct implements the `sdk.AppModule` interface and provides methods for initializing and exporting the module's genesis state, as well as for returning the module's name and consensus version. It also provides a `BeginBlock` method that is called at the beginning of each block and a `RegisterServices` method that registers the module's query and message servers.

The `ProvideModule` function is used to provide the `AuthzKeeper` and `Module` outputs for the `ModuleInputs` input. It creates a new `Keeper` object and a new `AppModule` object using the provided inputs and returns them as the `AuthzKeeper` and `Module` outputs, respectively.

The `ModuleInputs` struct defines the inputs required to create a new `Keeper` and `AppModule` object. It includes the key for the KV store, the codec, the account and bank keepers, the interface registry, and the message service router.

The `ModuleOutputs` struct defines the outputs returned by the `ProvideModule` function. It includes the `Keeper` object and the `AppModule` object.

Overall, this package provides the authorization functionality required for Cosmos SDK applications. It allows for the creation of custom authorization modules that can be used to define custom authorization rules and policies for Cosmos SDK applications.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file is part of the `authz` module in the `cosmos-sdk` project and defines the basic application module used by the module.

2. What external dependencies does this code file have?
- This code file has external dependencies on `github.com/cometbft/cometbft/abci/types`, `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/runtime`, `github.com/spf13/cobra`, `cosmossdk.io/core/address`, `cosmossdk.io/depinject`, `cosmossdk.io/errors`, `cosmossdk.io/store/types`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/baseapp`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/client`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/codec`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/codec/types`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/module`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/simulation`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/authz`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/authz/client/cli`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/authz/keeper`, and `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/authz/simulation`.

3. What is the role of `ProvideModule` function?
- The `ProvideModule` function is used by the dependency injection framework to provide the `authz` module with its dependencies, such as the `KVStoreKey`, `Codec`, `AccountKeeper`, `BankKeeper`, and `MessageRouter`. It returns the `Keeper` and `AppModule` objects as outputs.
