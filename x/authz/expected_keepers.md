The code above defines two interfaces, `AccountKeeper` and `BankKeeper`, that are expected to be implemented by other modules in the `cosmos-sdk` project. These interfaces are used to interact with accounts and retrieve account balances respectively.

The `AccountKeeper` interface has three methods: `GetAccount`, `NewAccountWithAddress`, and `SetAccount`. `GetAccount` takes a context and an `sdk.AccAddress` and returns an `sdk.AccountI` interface. This method is used to retrieve an account from the state based on its address. `NewAccountWithAddress` takes a context and an `sdk.AccAddress` and returns a new `sdk.AccountI` interface with the given address. This method is used to create a new account with a specific address. `SetAccount` takes a context and an `sdk.AccountI` interface and sets the account in the state. This method is used to update an existing account in the state.

The `BankKeeper` interface has two methods: `SpendableCoins` and `IsSendEnabledCoins`. `SpendableCoins` takes a context and an `sdk.AccAddress` and returns the spendable coins for that account. This method is used to retrieve the balance of an account. `IsSendEnabledCoins` takes a context and a list of `sdk.Coin` and returns an error if the coins cannot be sent. This method is used to check if a transaction can be sent based on the available balance of the sender's account.

These interfaces are used throughout the `cosmos-sdk` project to interact with accounts and retrieve balances. For example, the `bank` module in the `cosmos-sdk` project implements the `BankKeeper` interface to manage account balances and transactions. Other modules, such as the `staking` module, may use the `AccountKeeper` interface to manage accounts and update balances based on staking rewards.

Overall, these interfaces provide a standardized way for different modules in the `cosmos-sdk` project to interact with accounts and retrieve balances, making it easier to build and maintain the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines two interfaces, `AccountKeeper` and `BankKeeper`, which are expected to be implemented by other modules in the `cosmos-sdk` project.

2. What is the `address.Codec` interface used for in the `AccountKeeper` interface?
- The `address.Codec` interface is embedded in the `AccountKeeper` interface, indicating that any implementation of `AccountKeeper` is also expected to implement the `address.Codec` interface.

3. What is the difference between the `SpendableCoins` and `IsSendEnabledCoins` methods in the `BankKeeper` interface?
- The `SpendableCoins` method retrieves the spendable balance of an account, while the `IsSendEnabledCoins` method checks if a given set of coins can be sent from an account (i.e. if the account has enough balance and the coins are not locked).
