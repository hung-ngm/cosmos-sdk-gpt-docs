The `SignModeHandlerMap` type is a struct that implements the `SignModeHandler` interface. It is used to aggregate multiple `SignModeHandler`s into a single handler. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to handle different signing modes for transactions in the Cosmos SDK.

The `NewSignModeHandlerMap` function creates a new `SignModeHandlerMap` with the provided default mode and handlers. It takes in a default mode and a slice of `SignModeHandler`s. It then creates a map of sign mode handlers and a slice of sign modes. It loops through each handler and mode, checking for duplicates and adding them to the map and slice. If a duplicate is found, it panics with an error. Finally, it returns a new `SignModeHandlerMap` with the default mode, modes, and sign mode handlers.

The `DefaultMode` method returns the default sign mode of the `SignModeHandlerMap`.

The `Modes` method returns a slice of all the sign modes supported by the `SignModeHandlerMap`.

The `GetSignBytes` method takes in a sign mode, signer data, and a transaction and returns the bytes to be signed. It first checks if the sign mode is supported by the `SignModeHandlerMap`. If it is, it calls the `GetSignBytes` method of the corresponding sign mode handler and returns the result. If the sign mode is not supported, it returns an error.

The `GetSignBytesWithContext` method is similar to `GetSignBytes`, but it also takes in a context. It first checks if the sign mode is supported by the `SignModeHandlerMap`. If it is, it checks if the corresponding sign mode handler implements the `SignModeHandlerWithContext` interface. If it does, it calls the `GetSignBytesWithContext` method of the handler and returns the result. If it doesn't, it falls back to the stateless `GetSignBytes` method and returns the result.

Overall, this code provides a way to handle different signing modes for transactions in the Cosmos SDK. It allows for multiple sign mode handlers to be aggregated into a single handler, making it easier to manage and use in the larger project. Developers can use this code to create custom sign mode handlers and add them to the `SignModeHandlerMap` to support new signing modes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SignModeHandlerMap` type?
- The `SignModeHandlerMap` type is a handler that aggregates multiple `SignModeHandler`s into a single handler.

2. What does the `NewSignModeHandlerMap` function do?
- The `NewSignModeHandlerMap` function returns a new `SignModeHandlerMap` with the provided default mode and handlers.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetSignBytesWithContext` method?
- The `GetSignBytesWithContext` method returns the sign bytes for a transaction with the given context, signer data, and sign mode. If the underlying handler implements `SignModeHandlerWithContext`, it uses that method, otherwise it uses the stateless `GetSignBytes` method.
