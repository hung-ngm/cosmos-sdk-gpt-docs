This file defines two interfaces, `AccountKeeper` and `FeegrantKeeper`, that are used in the larger cosmos-sdk project. 

The `AccountKeeper` interface defines the contract needed for AccountKeeper related APIs. It provides support to use non-sdk AccountKeeper for AnteHandler's decorators. The interface has four methods:
- `GetParams`: This method takes a context and returns the account parameters.
- `GetAccount`: This method takes a context and an account address and returns the account associated with that address.
- `SetAccount`: This method takes a context and an account and sets the account in the account keeper.
- `GetModuleAddress`: This method takes a module name and returns the account address associated with that module.

The `FeegrantKeeper` interface defines the expected feegrant keeper. It has one method:
- `UseGrantedFees`: This method takes a context, granter address, grantee address, fees, and messages. It uses the granted fees to pay for the specified messages.

These interfaces are used in the larger cosmos-sdk project to provide a way to interact with the account keeper and feegrant keeper. For example, the `GetAccount` method in the `AccountKeeper` interface can be used to retrieve an account associated with a particular address. This account can then be used to perform actions such as sending tokens or voting. Similarly, the `UseGrantedFees` method in the `FeegrantKeeper` interface can be used to pay for messages using granted fees. 

Overall, these interfaces provide a way to interact with important components of the cosmos-sdk project and are essential for building decentralized applications on the Cosmos network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AccountKeeper` interface?
- The `AccountKeeper` interface defines the contract needed for AccountKeeper related APIs and provides support to use non-sdk AccountKeeper for AnteHandler's decorators.

2. What is the `FeegrantKeeper` interface used for?
- The `FeegrantKeeper` interface defines the expected feegrant keeper, which is used to grant fees to a specific account.

3. What is the `sdk` package imported for in this file?
- The `sdk` package is imported to use types defined in the `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types` package.
