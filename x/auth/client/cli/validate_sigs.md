The `cli` package contains the command-line interface (CLI) functionality for the Cosmos SDK. This file, `validate_signatures.go`, contains the implementation of the `validate-signatures` command. This command is used to validate the signatures of a transaction. It checks whether all required signers have signed the transaction, whether the signatures were collected in the right order, and if the signature is valid over the given transaction. 

The `GetValidateSignaturesCommand` function returns a `cobra.Command` object that represents the `validate-signatures` command. The `makeValidateSignaturesCmd` function returns a function that is executed when the `validate-signatures` command is run. This function reads the transaction from a file, validates the signatures, and prints the results.

The `printAndValidateSigs` function validates the signatures of a given transaction over its expected signers. It prints the addresses that must sign the transaction, those who have already signed it, and makes sure that signatures are in the correct order. If the `--offline` flag is set, signature validation over the transaction will not be performed as that will require RPC communication with a full node. 

The `readTxAndInitContexts` function reads the transaction from a file and initializes the client context and transaction factory. 

Overall, this file provides the functionality to validate the signatures of a transaction. It is used in the larger Cosmos SDK project to provide a CLI command for developers to validate the signatures of their transactions. 

Example usage:
```
$ cosmos-sdk validate-signatures tx.json
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetValidateSignaturesCommand` function?
- The `GetValidateSignaturesCommand` function returns a Cobra command that can be used to validate transaction signatures.

2. What does the `printAndValidateSigs` function do?
- The `printAndValidateSigs` function validates the signatures of a given transaction over its expected signers. It also verifies the signature over the transaction sign bytes if offline has not been supplied.

3. What is the purpose of the `readTxAndInitContexts` function?
- The `readTxAndInitContexts` function reads a transaction from a file and initializes the necessary contexts and factories for validating its signatures.
