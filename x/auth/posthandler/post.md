The `posthandler` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code that is responsible for handling post-processing logic after a transaction has been executed on the blockchain. This code is specifically focused on constructing a default SDK PostHandler.

The `HandlerOptions` struct is defined to hold any options that may be required for constructing a default SDK PostHandler. However, in this implementation, the struct is empty and does not contain any options.

The `NewPostHandler` function is the main function in this code. It returns an empty `PostHandler` chain by taking in the `HandlerOptions` struct as an argument. The function first initializes an empty array of `PostDecorator` objects. These decorators are functions that can be used to modify the response of a transaction after it has been executed. 

The function then returns a `PostHandler` chain by calling the `ChainPostDecorators` function from the `sdk` package. This function takes in an array of `PostDecorator` objects and returns a `PostHandler` chain that can be used to execute these decorators in a specific order. In this case, since the array is empty, the returned `PostHandler` chain is also empty.

This code can be used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to construct a default `PostHandler` chain that can be used to execute any post-processing logic required after a transaction has been executed on the blockchain. Developers can use this code as a starting point to add their own custom `PostDecorator` functions to the chain to modify the response of a transaction in a specific way. 

For example, a developer could create a custom `PostDecorator` function that adds a specific header to the response of a transaction. They could then add this function to the `PostHandler` chain returned by `NewPostHandler` to ensure that it is executed after the default post-processing logic.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HandlerOptions` struct?
   - The `HandlerOptions` struct is used to provide options for constructing a default SDK `PostHandler`.
2. What does the `NewPostHandler` function return?
   - The `NewPostHandler` function returns an empty `PostHandler` chain and an error (if any).
3. What is the role of `postDecorators` in the `NewPostHandler` function?
   - `postDecorators` is an array of `PostDecorator` functions that are used to decorate the `PostHandler` chain. In this case, an empty array is used to create an empty `PostHandler` chain.
