The `legacytx` package contains functions for converting signature data to amino-encoded signature bytes. The `SignatureDataToAminoSignature` function takes in a `SignatureData` object and a `codec.LegacyAmino` object and returns the amino-encoded signature bytes. This function only supports `SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON`. The `SignatureData` object can be of two types: `SingleSignatureData` or `MultiSignatureData`. If the `SignatureData` object is of type `SingleSignatureData`, the function returns the signature bytes directly. If the `SignatureData` object is of type `MultiSignatureData`, the function calls the `MultiSignatureDataToAminoMultisignature` function to convert the `MultiSignatureData` object to an `AminoMultisignature` object. The `AminoMultisignature` object is then marshalled using the `codec.LegacyAmino` object and returned as the amino-encoded signature bytes.

The `MultiSignatureDataToAminoMultisignature` function takes in a `MultiSignatureData` object and a `codec.LegacyAmino` object and returns an `AminoMultisignature` object. This function only supports `SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON`. The function first creates a slice of byte slices to hold the signature bytes for each signer. It then loops through each signature in the `MultiSignatureData` object and calls the `SignatureDataToAminoSignature` function to convert each signature to amino-encoded signature bytes. If any error occurs during the conversion, the function returns an error. If all signatures are successfully converted, the function returns an `AminoMultisignature` object with the bit array and signature bytes for each signer.

These functions are used in the larger project to encode signature data in the legacy Amino JSON format. This format is used in Cosmos SDK v0.39 and earlier versions. The functions provide a way to convert signature data to the required format for transactions to be signed and broadcasted on the Cosmos network. An example usage of these functions can be seen in the `StdTx` struct in the `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/tx` package, which uses the `LegacyAmino` codec to encode and decode transactions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides functions for converting signature data to amino-encoded signature bytes and for converting multi-signature data to an AminoMultisignature. It solves the problem of needing to encode signature data in a specific format for use in the cosmos-sdk.

2. What is the significance of SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON and why is it the only mode supported?
- SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON is a specific signing mode used in the cosmos-sdk. It is the only mode supported because this code is part of the legacytx package, which is used for backwards compatibility with older versions of the cosmos-sdk that only support this signing mode.

3. What is the purpose of the errors.Wrapf function used in MultiSignatureDataToAminoMultisignature?
- The errors.Wrapf function is used to add context to an error message. In this case, it is used to wrap an error returned by the SignatureDataToAminoSignature function with additional information about which signature is causing the error.
