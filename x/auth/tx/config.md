The code defines a configuration struct and functions for creating and manipulating transactions in the cosmos-sdk project. The `config` struct contains various fields for handling different aspects of transaction creation and manipulation, such as the signing mode handler, transaction encoder and decoder, and JSON encoder and decoder. 

The `NewTxConfig` function creates a new protobuf `TxConfig` using the provided `ProtoCodec` and enabled sign modes. The first enabled sign mode becomes the default sign mode. If the `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` is enabled, the function panics and suggests using `NewTxConfigWithTextual` instead. 

The `NewTxConfigWithTextual` function is similar to `NewTxConfig` but allows adding a `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` renderer. This is currently experimental and should only be used for testing purposes until Textual is fully released. 

The `NewTxConfigWithHandler` function creates a new protobuf `TxConfig` using the provided `ProtoCodec` and signing handler. 

The `NewTxBuilder` function creates a new `TxBuilder` using the `protoCodec` field of the `config` struct. 

The `WrapTxBuilder` function returns a builder from the provided transaction. It checks if the provided transaction is of type `wrapper` and returns an error if it is not. 

The `SignModeHandler` function returns the signing mode handler of the `config` struct. 

The `TxEncoder` function returns the transaction encoder of the `config` struct. 

The `TxDecoder` function returns the transaction decoder of the `config` struct. 

The `TxJSONEncoder` function returns the JSON encoder of the `config` struct. 

The `TxJSONDecoder` function returns the JSON decoder of the `config` struct. 

Overall, this code provides a set of functions and a configuration struct for creating and manipulating transactions in the cosmos-sdk project. It allows for customization of the signing mode handler and provides various encoders and decoders for transactions and JSON. These functions and struct can be used in other parts of the project to create and manipulate transactions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `config` struct and how is it used in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `config` struct is used to store various configuration options related to transaction signing and encoding, and is used to create a new `TxBuilder` and provide various encoding and decoding functions for transactions.
2. What is the purpose of the `NewTxConfig` and `NewTxConfigWithTextual` functions, and how do they differ?
- Both functions are used to create a new `TxConfig` object, but `NewTxConfigWithTextual` allows for the addition of a `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` renderer, which is currently experimental and should only be used for testing purposes.
3. What is the purpose of the `WrapTxBuilder` function, and what does it return?
- The `WrapTxBuilder` function takes a transaction and returns a new `TxBuilder` that wraps the provided transaction.
