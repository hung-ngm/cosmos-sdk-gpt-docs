The `tx` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to transaction handling. This specific file defines a `signModeDirectAuxHandler` struct that implements the `signing.SignModeHandler` interface. This interface is used to define how a transaction should be signed based on the signing mode. The `signModeDirectAuxHandler` struct defines the `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX` signing mode.

The `DefaultMode` method returns the default signing mode, which is `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX`. The `Modes` method returns a slice containing only `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX`. The `GetSignBytes` method takes in the signing mode, signer data, and the transaction to be signed. It returns the bytes that should be signed for the given transaction and signing mode.

The `GetSignBytes` method first checks if the given signing mode is `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX`. If not, it returns an error. It then checks if the given transaction is of type `wrapper`, which is a protobuf-encoded transaction. If not, it returns an error.

Next, it creates a `codectypes.Any` object containing the public key of the signer. It then retrieves the address of the signer from the signer data. If the address is empty, it returns an error. It then retrieves the fee payer address from the transaction and checks if it matches the signer address. If it does, it returns an error since the fee payer cannot use `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX`.

Finally, it creates a `types.SignDocDirectAux` object containing the necessary data for signing the transaction using `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX`. It marshals this object and returns the resulting bytes.

This code is used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to define how transactions should be signed using the `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX` signing mode. It is used by other parts of the project that handle transaction signing to ensure that transactions are signed correctly. For example, the `auth` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project uses this code to sign transactions when the `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX` signing mode is used.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `signModeDirectAuxHandler` struct?
- The `signModeDirectAuxHandler` struct defines the `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX` sign mode handler for transaction signing.

2. What is the `GetSignBytes` function doing?
- The `GetSignBytes` function takes in a sign mode, signer data, and transaction, and returns the bytes to be signed for the `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX` sign mode.

3. Why does the `feePayer` need to be checked in the `GetSignBytes` function?
- The `feePayer` needs to be checked in the `GetSignBytes` function because the `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX` sign mode does not sign over fees, which would create malleability issues. Therefore, the fee payer cannot use this sign mode.
