The code defines the default sign modes for protobuf transactions and provides a function to create a sign mode handler for these modes. The sign modes are defined as constants from the `signingtypes` package, which is imported from the `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/tx/signing` module. The default sign modes include `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT`, `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX`, and `SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON`. 

The `makeSignModeHandler` function takes in the default sign modes and a `textual.SignModeHandler` object, which is defined in the `cosmossdk.io/x/tx/signing/textual` package. It also takes in an optional list of custom sign mode handlers. The function returns a `signing.SignModeHandler` object that maps the sign modes to their respective handlers. 

The function first checks if there are any sign modes enabled. If not, it panics with an error message. It then creates a slice of `signing.SignModeHandler` objects with a length equal to the number of default sign modes plus the number of custom sign mode handlers. It then iterates over the default sign modes and creates a handler for each mode. The handler is determined by a switch statement that matches the sign mode to its corresponding handler. If the sign mode is `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL`, the handler is created using the `textual.SignModeHandler` object passed to the function. If the sign mode is not recognized, the function panics with an error message. 

After creating the handlers for the default sign modes, the function adds any custom sign mode handlers to the slice. It then returns a `signing.SignModeHandler` object created using the `signing.NewSignModeHandlerMap` function. This function takes in the first sign mode in the list of modes as the default sign mode and a slice of `signing.SignModeHandler` objects. It returns a `signing.SignModeHandler` object that maps each sign mode to its corresponding handler. 

This code is used in the larger project to define the default sign modes for protobuf transactions and to create a sign mode handler that can be used to sign transactions. The `makeSignModeHandler` function is called by other functions in the project that need to sign transactions using the default sign modes. Developers can also create their own custom sign mode handlers and pass them to the function to be included in the sign mode handler map. 

Example usage:

```
// create a sign mode handler for the default sign modes
handler := makeSignModeHandler(DefaultSignModes, nil)

// sign a transaction using the handler
txBytes := []byte("transaction bytes")
signerInfo := signing.SignerInfo{...}
mode := signingtypes.SignMode_SIGN_MODE_DIRECT
signature, err := handler.GetSignBytes(mode, txBytes, signerInfo)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
signedTx := signingtypes.StdSignature{...}
handler.Sign(mode, txBytes, signerInfo, signature, signedTx)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DefaultSignModes` variable?
   - `DefaultSignModes` is a slice of `signingtypes.SignMode` that contains the default sign modes enabled for protobuf transactions.
2. What is the purpose of the `makeSignModeHandler` function?
   - `makeSignModeHandler` returns a `signing.SignModeHandler` that supports the default protobuf sign modes and any custom sign modes provided as arguments.
3. Why is `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` not included in the `DefaultSignModes` slice?
   - `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` is not included in the `DefaultSignModes` slice because it is not yet released, and therefore not supported by all components of the Cosmos SDK. However, the `textual` sign mode handler is available in the package for testing purposes.
