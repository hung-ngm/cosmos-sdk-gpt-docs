This code defines a custom `SignModeHandler` for the `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` signing mode in the Cosmos SDK. This signing mode is not yet fully released, but can be manually enabled for testing purposes. 

The `SignModeHandler` interface defines methods for handling different signing modes in the SDK. The `signModeTextualHandler` struct implements this interface for the `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` mode. 

The `GetSignBytesWithContext` method of the `signModeTextualHandler` struct is responsible for generating the bytes to be signed for a transaction in the `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` mode. It takes in a `context.Context`, the signing mode, `SignerData`, and the transaction to be signed. It first checks that the signing mode is `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL`, and then proceeds to extract the necessary data from the transaction to generate the bytes to be signed. 

The `txsigning.TxData` struct is used to hold the necessary data for signing a transaction. It contains the `TxBody` and `AuthInfo` protobuf messages, as well as their corresponding byte representations. These messages contain the necessary information for generating the bytes to be signed, such as the account number, sequence, chain ID, and fee information. 

The `textual.SignModeHandler` struct is used to actually generate the bytes to be signed. It takes in a `txsigning.SignerData` struct, which contains the necessary signing information such as the public key and address, as well as the `TxData` struct. 

Overall, this code defines a custom `SignModeHandler` for the `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` signing mode in the Cosmos SDK. This signing mode is not yet fully released, but can be manually enabled for testing purposes. The `GetSignBytesWithContext` method of this handler is responsible for generating the bytes to be signed for a transaction in this mode, and it does so by extracting the necessary data from the transaction and passing it to the `textual.SignModeHandler`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this file and what package does it belong to?
- This file belongs to the `tx` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project and provides a `SignModeHandler` implementation for the `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` signing mode.

2. What is the `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` signing mode and why is it not enabled by default?
- `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` is a signing mode that signs a human-readable textual representation of the transaction. It is not enabled by default because it is still in development and has not been fully released yet.

3. What is the role of the `signModeTextualHandler` struct and its methods?
- The `signModeTextualHandler` struct is a `SignModeHandler` implementation for the `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` signing mode. Its methods define how to get the sign bytes for a transaction in this mode, as well as the default mode and available modes for this handler.
