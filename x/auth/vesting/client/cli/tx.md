The `cli` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains command-line interface (CLI) code for interacting with the vesting module. The vesting module is responsible for managing vesting accounts, which are accounts that hold tokens that are gradually released over time. The vesting module provides three types of vesting accounts: delayed vesting accounts, continuous vesting accounts, and permanently locked accounts.

The `GetTxCmd` function returns a `cobra.Command` object that represents the vesting module's transaction commands. The `NewMsgCreateVestingAccountCmd`, `NewMsgCreatePermanentLockedAccountCmd`, and `NewMsgCreatePeriodicVestingAccountCmd` functions return `cobra.Command` objects that represent CLI command handlers for creating different types of vesting accounts.

The `NewMsgCreateVestingAccountCmd` function creates a new vesting account funded with an allocation of tokens. The account can either be a delayed or continuous vesting account, which is determined by the `--delayed` flag. All vesting accounts created will have their start time set by the committed block's time. The end time must be provided as a UNIX epoch timestamp. This function takes three arguments: `to_address`, `amount`, and `end_time`. The `to_address` argument is the address of the account that will receive the vesting account. The `amount` argument is the amount of tokens to be vested. The `end_time` argument is the UNIX epoch timestamp when the vesting period ends.

The `NewMsgCreatePermanentLockedAccountCmd` function creates a new account funded with an allocation of permanently locked tokens. These tokens may be used for staking but are non-transferable. Staking rewards will accrue as liquid and transferable tokens. This function takes two arguments: `to_address` and `amount`. The `to_address` argument is the address of the account that will receive the locked tokens. The `amount` argument is the amount of tokens to be locked.

The `NewMsgCreatePeriodicVestingAccountCmd` function creates a new vesting account funded with an allocation of tokens that vest periodically. The vesting periods are sequential, in that the duration of a period only starts at the end of the previous period. The duration of the first period starts upon account creation. This function takes two arguments: `to_address` and `periods_json_file`. The `to_address` argument is the address of the account that will receive the vesting account. The `periods_json_file` argument is the path to a JSON file that contains an array of coin strings and UNIX epoch times for coins to vest.

The `VestingData` struct and `InputPeriod` struct are used to parse the JSON file passed to `NewMsgCreatePeriodicVestingAccountCmd`. The `VestingData` struct contains a `StartTime` field that represents the UNIX epoch timestamp when the vesting period starts and a `Periods` field that is an array of `InputPeriod` structs. Each `InputPeriod` struct contains a `Coins` field that is a string representing the amount of coins to vest and a `Length` field that is the length of the vesting period in seconds.

Overall, the `cli` package provides a CLI interface for creating different types of vesting accounts in the vesting module. These vesting accounts can be used to manage the release of tokens over time and to lock tokens for staking.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `cosmos-sdk/x/auth/vesting/types` package?
- The `cosmos-sdk/x/auth/vesting/types` package provides types for vesting accounts in the Cosmos SDK.

2. What is the difference between a delayed and continuous vesting account?
- A delayed vesting account is created if the `--delayed` flag is set to true, and the vesting period starts at a later time. A continuous vesting account starts vesting immediately.

3. What is the format of the JSON file that is passed as an argument to `NewMsgCreatePeriodicVestingAccountCmd`?
- The JSON file should contain an array of coin strings and unix epoch times for coins to vest, along with the start time and length of each period.
