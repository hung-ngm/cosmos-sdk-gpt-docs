This code defines two methods for the `MsgUpdateParams` struct, which is used in the `cosmos-sdk` project. The `MsgUpdateParams` struct is a message type that is used to update certain parameters in the system. 

The first method, `GetSignBytes()`, is used to get the bytes that should be signed by the user when they want to update the parameters. This method implements the `LegacyMsg` interface, which is used to support backwards compatibility with older versions of the system. The method takes the `MsgUpdateParams` message, marshals it into JSON format using the `ModuleCdc` codec, and then sorts the resulting bytes. The sorted bytes are then returned as the bytes that should be signed.

Here is an example of how this method might be used:

```
params := MsgUpdateParams{
    Authority: "cosmos1abcdefg",
    NewParams: []byte("new parameters"),
}
signBytes := params.GetSignBytes()
```

The `signBytes` variable would contain the bytes that should be signed by the user.

The second method, `GetSigners()`, is used to get the addresses of the signers who are expected to sign the message. In this case, there is only one signer, which is the authority that is specified in the `MsgUpdateParams` message. The method takes the `MsgUpdateParams` message, extracts the authority address from it, and returns it as a slice of `sdk.AccAddress` objects.

Here is an example of how this method might be used:

```
params := MsgUpdateParams{
    Authority: "cosmos1abcdefg",
    NewParams: []byte("new parameters"),
}
signers := params.GetSigners()
```

The `signers` variable would contain a slice with one element, which is the address of the authority specified in the `MsgUpdateParams` message.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MsgUpdateParams` message type?
- The `MsgUpdateParams` message type is used to update certain parameters and is expected to be signed by a specific authority.

2. What is the significance of the `GetSignBytes` function?
- The `GetSignBytes` function is used to generate the bytes that will be signed by the authority when sending a `MsgUpdateParams` message.

3. What is the role of the `legacytx` package in this file?
- The `legacytx` package is used to define a `LegacyMsg` interface that the `MsgUpdateParams` message type implements. This is likely related to backwards compatibility with older versions of the SDK.
