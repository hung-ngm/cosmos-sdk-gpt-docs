This file is a part of the cosmos-sdk project and contains code related to the "auth" module. The purpose of this code is to define constants and functions related to account authentication and storage.

The `ModuleName` constant defines the name of the module as "auth". The `StoreKey` constant defines the string representation of the store key for the auth module as "acc". The `FeeCollectorName` constant defines the root string for the fee collector account address as "fee_collector".

The `ParamsKey` variable defines the prefix for the params key. The `AddressStoreKeyPrefix` variable defines the prefix for the account-by-address store. The `GlobalAccountNumberKey` variable defines the param key for the global account number. The `AccountNumberStoreKeyPrefix` variable defines the prefix for the account-by-id store.

The `AddressStoreKey` function takes an `sdk.AccAddress` parameter and returns a byte slice that represents the key used to get the address from the account store. The `AccountNumberStoreKey` function takes an `accountNumber` parameter of type `uint64` and returns a byte slice that represents the key used to get the account address from the account store.

These functions and constants are used in the larger project to manage account authentication and storage. For example, the `AddressStoreKey` function can be used to get the key for a specific account address in the account store. The `AccountNumberStoreKey` function can be used to get the key for a specific account number in the account store. The constants and variables defined in this file provide a standardized way to access and manage account information in the cosmos-sdk project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file is part of the `cosmos-sdk` project and defines constants, variables, and functions related to the `auth` module.

2. What is the `AddressStoreKey` function used for?
- The `AddressStoreKey` function takes an `sdk.AccAddress` and returns a byte slice that can be used to retrieve the corresponding account from the account store.

3. What is the difference between `AddressStoreKeyPrefix` and `AccountNumberStoreKeyPrefix`?
- `AddressStoreKeyPrefix` is used as a prefix for the key that retrieves an account by its address, while `AccountNumberStoreKeyPrefix` is used as a prefix for the key that retrieves an account by its account number.
