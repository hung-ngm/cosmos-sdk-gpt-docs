The `cli` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code for the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cosmos SDK. This particular file defines functions for adding core SDK sub-commands into the genesis command.

The `GenesisCoreCommand` function is deprecated and has been replaced by the `Commands` function. Both functions take in a `txConfig` object, a `moduleBasics` object, and a `defaultNodeHome` string. The `txConfig` object is used to configure transaction encoding and signing. The `moduleBasics` object is a collection of basic modules that are used to construct the application. The `defaultNodeHome` string is the default home directory for the application.

The `Commands` function returns a `cobra.Command` object that adds core SDK sub-commands into the genesis command. These sub-commands include `GenTxCmd`, `MigrateGenesisCmd`, `CollectGenTxsCmd`, `ValidateGenesisCmd`, and `AddGenesisAccountCmd`. These sub-commands are used to generate and validate the genesis file for the application.

The `CommandsWithCustomMigrationMap` function is similar to the `Commands` function, but it also takes in a `migrationMap` object of type `genutiltypes.MigrationMap`. This object is used to add a custom migration map to the application. The custom migration map can be used to migrate data from previous versions of the application to the current version.

Overall, this file provides functions for adding core SDK sub-commands into the genesis command, which are used to generate and validate the genesis file for the application. These functions are important for setting up the initial state of the application and ensuring that it is compatible with previous versions of the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GenesisCoreCommand` function and why is it deprecated?
- The `GenesisCoreCommand` function adds core SDK sub-commands into the genesis command, but it is deprecated and should be replaced with `Commands`.
2. What is the difference between `Commands` and `CommandsWithCustomMigrationMap` functions?
- `Commands` adds core SDK sub-commands into the genesis command, while `CommandsWithCustomMigrationMap` adds core SDK sub-commands into the genesis command with a custom migration map that can be used by the application to add its own migration map.
3. What are the sub-commands added by the `Commands` function?
- The `Commands` function adds several sub-commands to the genesis command, including `GenTxCmd`, `MigrateGenesisCmd`, `CollectGenTxsCmd`, `ValidateGenesisCmd`, and `AddGenesisAccountCmd`.
