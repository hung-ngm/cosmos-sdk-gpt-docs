This file defines two constants that are used in the crisis module of the larger cosmos-sdk project. The first constant, `EventTypeInvariant`, is a string that represents the type of event that is emitted when an invariant is broken. Invariants are a type of constraint that must always hold true in the system, and if they are ever violated, it indicates a critical error that needs to be addressed immediately. The `EventTypeInvariant` constant is used to identify these events so that they can be handled appropriately.

The second constant, `AttributeKeyRoute`, is a string that represents the key used to store the route of a message in an event attribute. In the cosmos-sdk framework, messages are used to represent actions that can be taken by users or other actors in the system. When a message is processed, it may generate one or more events that provide information about the outcome of the action. These events can include attributes that provide additional context about the event, such as the route that was taken by the message. The `AttributeKeyRoute` constant is used to identify this attribute so that it can be accessed and processed by other parts of the system.

Here is an example of how these constants might be used in the larger cosmos-sdk project:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/crisis"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
)

func handleInvariantEvent(event types.Event) {
    if event.Type == crisis.EventTypeInvariant {
        // Handle the invariant event
    }
}

func handleMessageEvent(event types.Event) {
    if route, ok := event.Attributes[crisis.AttributeKeyRoute]; ok {
        // Handle the message event with the given route
    }
}
```

In this example, we define two functions that handle different types of events that can be generated by the crisis module. The `handleInvariantEvent` function checks if the event is of type `EventTypeInvariant`, and if so, it handles the event appropriately. The `handleMessageEvent` function checks if the event has an attribute with the key `AttributeKeyRoute`, and if so, it handles the event based on the route that was taken by the message. These functions demonstrate how the constants defined in this file can be used to identify and process different types of events in the cosmos-sdk framework.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `crisis` module in the `cosmos-sdk` project?**\
   The code defines event types for the `crisis` module in the `cosmos-sdk` project, but it does not provide information on the module's functionality or use case.

2. **What is the significance of the `EventTypeInvariant` constant?**\
   The `EventTypeInvariant` constant likely represents an event type related to an invariant check in the `crisis` module, but without further context it is unclear what this check entails.

3. **What is the `AttributeKeyRoute` constant used for?**\
   The `AttributeKeyRoute` constant likely represents a key used to store a route attribute in an event related to the `crisis` module, but without further context it is unclear what this attribute represents or how it is used.
