This code is a part of the `cosmos-sdk` project and is located in the `keeper` package. The purpose of this code is to handle the initialization and exporting of the crisis module's genesis state. 

The `InitGenesis` function is called during the initialization of the crisis module's genesis state. It takes in a `sdk.Context` and a pointer to a `types.GenesisState` object. The function sets the constant fee for the crisis module by calling the `SetConstantFee` function of the `Keeper` struct. If there is an error while setting the constant fee, the function panics.

The `ExportGenesis` function is called to export the current state of the crisis module's genesis. It takes in a `sdk.Context` and returns a pointer to a `types.GenesisState` object. The function retrieves the constant fee for the crisis module by calling the `GetConstantFee` function of the `Keeper` struct. It then creates a new `GenesisState` object with the retrieved constant fee and returns it.

These functions are important for the proper functioning of the crisis module in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project. The `InitGenesis` function ensures that the crisis module is initialized with the correct constant fee, which is used to prevent certain types of attacks on the network. The `ExportGenesis` function allows the current state of the crisis module to be exported and used in other parts of the project, such as during upgrades or backups.

Example usage of these functions can be seen in other parts of the `cosmos-sdk` project, such as in the `app` package where the `InitChain` and `ExportAppStateAndValidators` functions are defined. These functions call the `InitGenesis` and `ExportGenesis` functions of various modules, including the crisis module, to properly initialize and export the state of the entire network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InitGenesis` function?
- The `InitGenesis` function is used to initialize the crisis genesis state by setting the constant fee.

2. What is the `ExportGenesis` function used for?
- The `ExportGenesis` function is used to export the current state of the keeper as a `GenesisState` object.

3. What is the `types` package being imported for?
- The `types` package is being imported to access the `GenesisState` type used in the `InitGenesis` and `ExportGenesis` functions.
