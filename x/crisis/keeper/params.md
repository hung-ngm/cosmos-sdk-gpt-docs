This code is a part of the `cosmos-sdk` project and is located in the `keeper` package. The purpose of this code is to provide functions for getting and setting a constant fee in the store. 

The `GetConstantFee` function retrieves the constant fee from the store by taking in a `sdk.Context` object and returning a `sdk.Coin` object. It first gets the store using the `KVStore` method and then retrieves the constant fee using the `Get` method and the `ConstantFeeKey` key. If the constant fee is not found in the store, it returns an empty `sdk.Coin` object. If the constant fee is found, it unmarshals the bytes using the `cdc.MustUnmarshal` method and returns the `sdk.Coin` object.

The `SetConstantFee` function sets the constant fee in the store by taking in a `sdk.Context` object and a `sdk.Coin` object and returning an error. It first checks if the `sdk.Coin` object is valid and not negative using the `IsValid` and `IsNegative` methods. If it is not valid or negative, it returns an error using the `Wrapf` method from the `errorsmod` package. If it is valid, it gets the store using the `KVStore` method and marshals the `sdk.Coin` object using the `cdc.Marshal` method. It then sets the constant fee in the store using the `Set` method and the `ConstantFeeKey` key.

These functions are used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to manage the constant fee for the `crisis` module. The `crisis` module is responsible for handling system-level issues such as preventing the blockchain from running out of resources. The constant fee is used to prevent spam transactions and to incentivize users to use the blockchain responsibly. 

Example usage of these functions would be as follows:

```
// create a new coin object with 1000 units of the default denomination
constantFee := sdk.NewCoin(sdk.DefaultBondDenom, sdk.NewInt(1000))

// set the constant fee in the store
err := keeper.SetConstantFee(ctx, constantFee)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// get the constant fee from the store
fee := keeper.GetConstantFee(ctx)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `cosmos-sdk/x/crisis/types` package being imported?
- It is unclear from this code snippet what specific functionality from the `cosmos-sdk/x/crisis/types` package is being used.

2. What is the `cdc` variable and where is it defined?
- The `cdc` variable is used to marshal and unmarshal data, but it is not clear from this code snippet where it is defined or initialized.

3. What is the significance of the `ConstantFeeKey` variable?
- It is unclear from this code snippet what the `ConstantFeeKey` variable represents or how it is used within the `GetConstantFee` and `SetConstantFee` functions.
