This code defines a constant variable `ModuleName` with the value "params". This variable is likely used as a reference throughout the larger project to identify and reference the specific module related to parameters. 

The `params` module may be responsible for managing and storing various parameters used throughout the project, such as network settings or consensus rules. By defining a constant variable for the module name, it allows for easier and more consistent referencing of the module throughout the codebase. 

For example, if another file in the project needs to access a function or data related to the `params` module, it can simply import the `types` package and reference `types.ModuleName` to ensure it is accessing the correct module. 

Overall, this code serves as a small but important piece in the larger project's organization and structure. By defining a constant variable for the module name, it helps ensure consistency and clarity throughout the codebase.
