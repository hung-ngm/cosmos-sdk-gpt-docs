The `NewSubmitParamChangeProposalTxCmd` function is a CLI command handler that creates a parameter change proposal governance transaction. This function is part of the `cosmos-sdk` project and is located in the `cli` package. 

The purpose of this function is to allow users to submit a parameter change proposal along with an initial deposit. The proposal details must be supplied via a JSON file. The function parses the JSON file and creates a `ParameterChangeProposal` object using the parsed data. The `ParameterChangeProposal` object contains the title, description, and changes to be made to the parameters. 

The function then creates a `MsgSubmitProposal` message using the `ParameterChangeProposal` object, the deposit, and the sender's address. The message is then broadcasted to the network using the `GenerateOrBroadcastTxCLI` function. 

This function is useful for users who want to propose changes to the parameters of the `cosmos-sdk` project. It allows them to easily create a proposal and submit it to the network. 

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```
$ cosmos-sdk tx gov submit-proposal param-change <path/to/proposal.json> --from=<key_or_address>
```

Where `proposal.json` contains:

```
{
  "title": "Staking Param Change",
  "description": "Update max validators",
  "changes": [
    {
      "subspace": "staking",
      "key": "MaxValidators",
      "value": 105
    }
  ],
  "deposit": "1000stake"
}
```

This example creates a proposal to update the maximum number of validators in the staking subspace to 105 and submits it to the network.
