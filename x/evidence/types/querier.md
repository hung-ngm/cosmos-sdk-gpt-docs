This file is a part of the cosmos-sdk project and contains code related to the evidence module. The evidence module is responsible for handling evidence of misbehavior on the blockchain. This code defines the routes for querying evidence and provides functions for creating instances of query requests and parameters.

The `QueryEvidence` and `QueryAllEvidence` constants define the names of the routes for querying evidence. These routes can be used to retrieve specific evidence or all evidence on the blockchain.

The `NewQueryEvidenceRequest` function creates a new instance of `QueryEvidenceRequest` with the given hash. This request can be used to query for evidence with a specific hash.

```go
request := NewQueryEvidenceRequest("hash123")
```

The `NewQueryAllEvidenceRequest` function creates a new instance of `QueryAllEvidenceRequest` with the given `PageRequest`. This request can be used to query for all evidence on the blockchain with pagination.

```go
pageReq := query.NewPageRequest(1, 10)
request := NewQueryAllEvidenceRequest(pageReq)
```

The `QueryAllEvidenceParams` struct defines the parameters necessary for querying all evidence on the blockchain. It includes the page number and limit for pagination.

The `NewQueryAllEvidenceParams` function creates a new instance of `QueryAllEvidenceParams` with the given page number and limit.

```go
params := NewQueryAllEvidenceParams(1, 10)
```

Overall, this code provides the necessary functionality for querying evidence on the blockchain. It can be used by other modules in the cosmos-sdk project that need to handle evidence of misbehavior.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `query` package import?
- The `query` package is being imported from the `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types` module to be used in this file.

2. What is the difference between `QueryEvidence` and `QueryAllEvidence` constants?
- `QueryEvidence` is used to route queries for a specific evidence, while `QueryAllEvidence` is used to route queries for all evidence.

3. What is the purpose of the `NewQueryAllEvidenceParams` function?
- The `NewQueryAllEvidenceParams` function is used to create a new instance of `QueryAllEvidenceParams` which defines the necessary parameters for querying all evidence.
