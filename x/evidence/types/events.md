This code defines two constants related to the evidence module events in the cosmos-sdk project. The first constant, `EventTypeSubmitEvidence`, is a string that represents the event type for submitting evidence. The second constant, `AttributeKeyEvidenceHash`, is a string that represents the key for the evidence hash attribute.

These constants are likely used throughout the project to ensure consistency in event types and attribute keys related to the evidence module. For example, when submitting evidence, the `EventTypeSubmitEvidence` constant may be used to specify the event type in the event struct, and the `AttributeKeyEvidenceHash` constant may be used to specify the evidence hash attribute in the attribute map.

Here is an example of how these constants may be used in the larger project:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/evidence/types"
)

func submitEvidence(evidenceHash []byte) {
    // create event struct
    event := types.NewEvent(types.EventTypeSubmitEvidence, map[string]string{
        types.AttributeKeyEvidenceHash: string(evidenceHash),
    })

    // emit event
    ctx.EventManager().EmitEvent(event)
}
```

In this example, the `submitEvidence` function creates an event struct using the `NewEvent` function from the `types` package. The `EventTypeSubmitEvidence` constant is used to specify the event type, and the `AttributeKeyEvidenceHash` constant is used to specify the evidence hash attribute in the attribute map. The event is then emitted using the event manager from the context.

Overall, this code plays an important role in ensuring consistency and clarity in the evidence module events throughout the cosmos-sdk project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `types` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `types` package likely contains various data types and structures used throughout the `cosmos-sdk` project.

2. What is the significance of the `EventTypeSubmitEvidence` constant?
- The `EventTypeSubmitEvidence` constant likely represents an event type that is triggered when evidence is submitted within the `cosmos-sdk` project.

3. What is the purpose of the `AttributeKeyEvidenceHash` constant?
- The `AttributeKeyEvidenceHash` constant likely represents a key used to access the hash value of evidence within the `cosmos-sdk` project.
