This file is part of the cosmos-sdk project and is generated by protoc-gen-grpc-gateway. It contains functions that handle HTTP requests and translate them into gRPC calls for the Query service. The Query service is responsible for handling queries related to evidence in the Cosmos network.

The functions in this file are used to register HTTP handlers for the Query service and to forward requests to the gRPC endpoint over a client connection. The RegisterQueryHandlerServer function registers the HTTP handlers for the Query service to a ServeMux, which is an HTTP request multiplexer. The RegisterQueryHandlerFromEndpoint function is similar to RegisterQueryHandler but automatically dials to an endpoint and closes the connection when the context is done. The RegisterQueryHandlerClient function registers the HTTP handlers for the Query service to a ServeMux and forwards requests to the gRPC endpoint over a QueryClient implementation.

The functions request_Query_Evidence_0 and local_request_Query_Evidence_0 handle HTTP GET requests for evidence with a specific hash. They parse the hash parameter from the request URL and populate a QueryEvidenceRequest message with the hash value. They then call the Evidence function of the QueryClient or QueryServer to retrieve the evidence with the specified hash. The response message is forwarded to the HTTP response writer.

The functions request_Query_AllEvidence_0 and local_request_Query_AllEvidence_0 handle HTTP GET requests for all evidence in the network. They populate a QueryAllEvidenceRequest message with any query parameters in the request URL and call the AllEvidence function of the QueryClient or QueryServer to retrieve all evidence in the network. The response message is forwarded to the HTTP response writer.

Overall, this file provides a bridge between HTTP requests and gRPC calls for the Query service related to evidence in the Cosmos network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file is a reverse proxy that translates gRPC into RESTful JSON APIs for the `cosmos-sdk` project's `evidence` package.

2. What are the functions `request_Query_Evidence_0` and `request_Query_AllEvidence_0` doing?
- `request_Query_Evidence_0` and `request_Query_AllEvidence_0` are functions that handle HTTP GET requests for querying evidence by hash and querying all evidence, respectively. They parse the request parameters, populate the corresponding protocol buffer message, and call the gRPC server's `Evidence` and `AllEvidence` methods to retrieve the requested data.

3. What is the purpose of the `RegisterQueryHandlerServer` and `RegisterQueryHandlerClient` functions?
- `RegisterQueryHandlerServer` and `RegisterQueryHandlerClient` are functions that register HTTP handlers for the `Query` service to a `runtime.ServeMux`. They forward requests to the gRPC endpoint over a client connection or directly to the server implementation, respectively.
