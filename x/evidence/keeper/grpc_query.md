The code above is a part of the cosmos-sdk project and is located in the `keeper` package. The purpose of this code is to implement two gRPC methods for querying evidence. The `Evidence` method retrieves a single piece of evidence by its hash, while the `AllEvidence` method retrieves all evidence stored in the KVStore.

The `Evidence` method first checks if the request is empty or if the hash is invalid. If the hash is valid, it is decoded from a string to bytes. The `GetEvidence` method is then called to retrieve the evidence from the KVStore. If the evidence is not found, an error is returned. If the evidence is found, it is converted to a proto message and then to a `codectypes.Any` type. Finally, the `QueryEvidenceResponse` is returned with the evidence.

The `AllEvidence` method first checks if the request is empty. It then retrieves all evidence from the KVStore using the `GetAllEvidence` method. The evidence is stored in a slice of `codectypes.Any` types. The `query.Paginate` function is then called to paginate the evidence. For each piece of evidence, it is unmarshaled and converted to a proto message and then to a `codectypes.Any` type. The evidence is then appended to the slice of evidence. Finally, the `QueryAllEvidenceResponse` is returned with the evidence and pagination information.

This code can be used in the larger project to query evidence stored in the KVStore. The `Evidence` method can be used to retrieve a single piece of evidence by its hash, while the `AllEvidence` method can be used to retrieve all evidence stored in the KVStore.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file is a part of the `cosmos-sdk` project and contains implementations for two gRPC methods `Evidence` and `AllEvidence` for querying evidence.

2. What is the role of `Keeper` in this code?
- `Keeper` is a struct that implements the `types.QueryServer` interface and provides the implementation for the `Evidence` and `AllEvidence` gRPC methods.

3. What is the purpose of `codectypes.NewAnyWithValue(msg)` in this code?
- `codectypes.NewAnyWithValue(msg)` is used to create a new `Any` type from a given proto message `msg`. This is used to return the evidence in a generic format that can be unmarshalled into the appropriate type by the caller.
