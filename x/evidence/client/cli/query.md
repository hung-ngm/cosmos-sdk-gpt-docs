The `cli` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code for the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cosmos SDK. This file, `query.go`, defines the CLI commands for querying evidence in the evidence module. 

The `GetQueryCmd` function returns a Cobra command that allows users to query for evidence by hash or for all submitted evidence in a paginated format. The command includes a short description and an example of how to use it. The `QueryEvidenceCmd` function is the command handler for evidence querying. It checks if the user has provided a hash as an argument, and if so, calls the `queryEvidence` function to query for a single evidence by the given hash. Otherwise, it reads the pagination flags and calls the `queryAllEvidence` function to return all evidences in a paginated format. 

The `queryEvidence` function queries the evidence module for a single evidence by the given hash. It creates a new query client and sends a `QueryEvidenceRequest` with the hash to the evidence module. If the query is successful, it prints the evidence to the console using the `PrintProto` function of the client context. 

The `queryAllEvidence` function returns all evidences in a paginated format. It creates a new query client and sends a `QueryAllEvidenceRequest` with the pagination parameters to the evidence module. If the query is successful, it prints the evidences to the console using the `PrintProto` function of the client context. 

Overall, this code provides a convenient way for users to query for evidence in the evidence module of the Cosmos SDK. It demonstrates the use of the `cobra` package for building CLI commands and the `cosmos-sdk` packages for interacting with the evidence module. 

Example usage:
```
$ cosmos-sdk query evidence DF0C23E8634E480F84B9D5674A7CDC9816466DEC28A3358F73260F68D28D7660
$ cosmos-sdk query evidence --page=2 --limit=50
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides CLI commands for querying evidence in the cosmos-sdk project.

2. What dependencies are required for this code to function?
- This code requires several dependencies, including `cosmos-sdk/types/query`, `cosmos-sdk/client`, `github.com/spf13/cobra`, and `cosmossdk.io/x/evidence/types`.

3. What commands are available for querying evidence using this code?
- This code provides two commands for querying evidence: `query <hash>` for querying a single evidence by hash, and `query --page=<page> --limit=<limit>` for querying all evidence in a paginated format.
