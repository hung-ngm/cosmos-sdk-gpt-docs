The `cli` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code for the command-line interface (CLI) of the project. The `GetTxCmd` function in this file returns a CLI command that has all the native evidence module transaction commands mounted. It also mounts all child commands implemented by outside modules under a sub-command. This allows external modules to implement custom evidence types and handlers while having the ability to create and sign transactions containing them all from a single root command.

The `GetTxCmd` function takes an array of child commands as input and returns a `cobra.Command` object. The `cobra` package is a popular CLI library in Go that provides a simple interface for creating powerful CLI applications. The returned command has the name of the evidence module and a short description of its purpose. It also disables flag parsing and sets a minimum distance for suggestions. Finally, it sets the `RunE` field to `client.ValidateCmd`, which is a function that validates the command before executing it.

The `SubmitEvidenceCmd` function returns the top-level evidence submission command handler. All concrete evidence submission child command handlers should be registered under this command. It returns a `cobra.Command` object with the name "submit" and a short description of its purpose.

The purpose of this code is to provide a simple and extensible CLI interface for the evidence module of the `cosmos-sdk` project. It allows developers to create and sign transactions containing custom evidence types and handlers from a single root command. This can be useful for building applications that require evidence submission and verification, such as decentralized exchanges or prediction markets. 

Example usage:

```
$ cosmos-sdk tx evidence submit --type=myCustomEvidence --data=myCustomData
```

This command submits a transaction containing custom evidence of type "myCustomEvidence" and data "myCustomData".
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetTxCmd` function?
- The `GetTxCmd` function returns a CLI command that has all the native evidence module tx commands mounted, and allows external modules to implement custom evidence types and handlers while having the ability to create and sign txs containing them all from a single root command.

2. What is the purpose of the `SubmitEvidenceCmd` function?
- The `SubmitEvidenceCmd` function returns the top-level evidence submission command handler, and all concrete evidence submission child command handlers should be registered under this command.

3. What is the purpose of the `DisableFlagParsing` field in the `cmd` variable?
- The `DisableFlagParsing` field in the `cmd` variable is set to true, which disables the parsing of flags and arguments for the command and its sub-commands.
