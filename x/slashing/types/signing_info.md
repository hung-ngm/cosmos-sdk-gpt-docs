The `types` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains various data structures and functions that are used throughout the project. This specific file defines two functions related to `ValidatorSigningInfo`.

The `NewValidatorSigningInfo` function creates a new instance of `ValidatorSigningInfo` struct. This struct contains information about a validator's signing status, such as the validator's address, start height, index offset, jailed until time, tombstoned status, and missed blocks counter. The function takes in these parameters and returns a new `ValidatorSigningInfo` instance with the given values.

Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
import (
    "time"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
)

consAddr := types.ConsAddress{...}
startHeight := int64(1000)
indexOffset := int64(10)
jailedUntil := time.Now().Add(time.Hour * 24 * 7) // jailed for 1 week
tombstoned := false
missedBlocksCounter := int64(0)

validatorSigningInfo := types.NewValidatorSigningInfo(
    consAddr, startHeight, indexOffset, jailedUntil, tombstoned, missedBlocksCounter,
)
```

The `UnmarshalValSigningInfo` function unmarshals a `ValidatorSigningInfo` struct from a byte array. It takes in a `codec.Codec` instance and a byte array as parameters, and returns a `ValidatorSigningInfo` instance and an error (if any). This function is used to deserialize a `ValidatorSigningInfo` struct from a byte array that was previously serialized and stored in a database.

Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/codec"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
)

var cdc = codec.New()

// assume that value is a byte array retrieved from a database
value := []byte{...}

validatorSigningInfo, err := types.UnmarshalValSigningInfo(cdc, value)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

Overall, this file provides two important functions for working with `ValidatorSigningInfo` structs in the `cosmos-sdk` project. The `NewValidatorSigningInfo` function is used to create new instances of this struct, while the `UnmarshalValSigningInfo` function is used to deserialize this struct from a byte array.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ValidatorSigningInfo` struct?
   - The `ValidatorSigningInfo` struct is used to store information about a validator's signing status, such as missed blocks and whether they are jailed or tombstoned.
2. What is the `UnmarshalValSigningInfo` function used for?
   - The `UnmarshalValSigningInfo` function is used to deserialize a validator signing info object from a byte array stored in a database.
3. What is the `NewValidatorSigningInfo` function used for?
   - The `NewValidatorSigningInfo` function is used to create a new instance of the `ValidatorSigningInfo` struct with the provided parameters.
