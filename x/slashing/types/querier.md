This code defines constants and a struct for querying information related to slashing in the cosmos-sdk project. The `const` block defines three query endpoints: `QueryParameters`, `QuerySigningInfo`, and `QuerySigningInfos`. These endpoints are used to query different types of information related to slashing.

The `QuerySigningInfosParams` struct defines the parameters for the `QuerySigningInfos` endpoint. It has two fields: `Page` and `Limit`, which are used to specify the page number and the number of results per page, respectively. The `NewQuerySigningInfosParams` function is a constructor for this struct, which takes in the `page` and `limit` parameters and returns a new instance of `QuerySigningInfosParams`.

This code is used in the larger cosmos-sdk project to provide a standardized way of querying information related to slashing. Developers can use these constants and structs to build their own query functions or to interact with existing query functions that use these endpoints. For example, a developer could use the `QuerySigningInfos` endpoint to retrieve a list of signing information for validators that have been slashed. They could use the `NewQuerySigningInfosParams` function to create a new instance of `QuerySigningInfosParams` with the desired page and limit parameters.

Overall, this code provides a simple and consistent way of querying information related to slashing in the cosmos-sdk project. By using these constants and structs, developers can avoid hardcoding endpoint names and parameter structures, which can make their code more maintainable and easier to read.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `QueryEndpoints` constants?
   - The `QueryEndpoints` constants define the names of the different query endpoints supported by the slashing querier.
2. What is the purpose of the `QuerySigningInfosParams` struct?
   - The `QuerySigningInfosParams` struct defines the parameters for the `custom/slashing/signingInfos` query endpoint.
3. What does the `NewQuerySigningInfosParams` function do?
   - The `NewQuerySigningInfosParams` function creates a new instance of the `QuerySigningInfosParams` struct with the specified `page` and `limit` values.
