The `keeper` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains the implementation of the `Keeper` interface, which is responsible for managing the state of the blockchain. This file in particular, `hooks.go`, defines a struct `Hooks` that acts as a wrapper for the `slashing` keeper. The `Hooks` struct implements the `types.StakingHooks` interface, which defines a set of methods that are called at various points during the staking process. 

The `AfterValidatorBonded` method is called after a validator has been bonded. It updates the signing information for the validator by either creating a new signing info or updating the existing one. The signing info contains information about the validator's signing status, such as the height at which it started signing, and whether it has been offline. 

The `AfterValidatorRemoved` method is called after a validator has been removed. It deletes the address-pubkey relation for the validator. 

The `AfterValidatorCreated` method is called after a validator has been created. It adds the address-pubkey relation for the validator. 

The remaining methods in the `Hooks` struct are not implemented and simply return `nil`. 

Overall, the purpose of this file is to define the `Hooks` struct and its methods, which are used to manage the staking process in the `cosmos-sdk` project. The `Hooks` struct acts as a wrapper for the `slashing` keeper and implements the `types.StakingHooks` interface, which defines a set of methods that are called at various points during the staking process. The methods in this file are responsible for updating the signing information for validators, adding and deleting address-pubkey relations, and performing other tasks related to staking. 

Example usage:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/slashing/keeper"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/slashing/types"
)

func main() {
    // create a new keeper
    k := keeper.NewKeeper()

    // get the slashing hooks
    hooks := k.Hooks()

    // create a new validator
    valAddr := types.ValAddress("...")
    validator := k.sk.Validator(ctx, valAddr)

    // add the validator's pubkey
    hooks.AfterValidatorCreated(ctx, valAddr)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Hooks` struct and how is it used in the `Keeper`?
   
   The `Hooks` struct is a wrapper for the slashing keeper and implements the `types.StakingHooks` interface. It is used to define functions that are called before or after certain events occur in the staking module, such as validator creation or removal.

2. What does the `AfterValidatorBonded` function do?
   
   The `AfterValidatorBonded` function updates the signing information for a validator when they are bonded. If the validator already has signing information, it updates the start height. Otherwise, it creates new signing information.

3. What is the purpose of the `deleteAddrPubkeyRelation` function and when is it called?
   
   The `deleteAddrPubkeyRelation` function deletes the address-pubkey relation for a validator when they are removed. It is called in the `AfterValidatorRemoved` function.
