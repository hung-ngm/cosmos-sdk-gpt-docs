The `simulation` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to simulating the behavior of the blockchain. This particular file contains a function called `NewDecodeStore` that returns a closure that can be used to decode key-value pairs stored in the simulation store. 

The purpose of this function is to decode the KVPair's value to the corresponding slashing type. The `switch` statement in the function checks the prefix of the key to determine which type of slashing information is being decoded. There are three cases: `ValidatorSigningInfoKeyPrefix`, `ValidatorMissedBlockBitmapKeyPrefix`, and `AddrPubkeyRelationKeyPrefix`. 

For each case, the function unmarshals the value of the KVPair using the provided binary codec and returns a formatted string that contains the decoded information. If the key prefix is not recognized, the function panics with an error message.

This function is used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to simulate the behavior of the blockchain and test the slashing module. The slashing module is responsible for penalizing validators who misbehave by slashing their staked tokens. The `NewDecodeStore` function is used to decode the stored information related to validator signing and missed blocks, as well as the relationship between validator addresses and public keys. This information is used to determine whether a validator should be penalized for misbehavior.

Example usage of this function might look like:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/codec"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/kv"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/slashing/types"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/simulation"
)

// create a codec
cdc := codec.New()

// create a KVPair to decode
kvPair := kv.Pair{
    Key:   []byte{types.ValidatorSigningInfoKeyPrefix},
    Value: []byte{0x01, 0x02, 0x03},
}

// create a decoder function using the NewDecodeStore closure
decoder := simulation.NewDecodeStore(cdc)

// decode the KVPair
decoded := decoder(kvPair, kvPair)

// print the decoded information
fmt.Println(decoded)
```

This would output the decoded `ValidatorSigningInfo` information in a formatted string.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a function called `NewDecodeStore` that returns a closure which takes two `kv.Pair` arguments and unmarshals their values to the corresponding slashing type.

2. What external packages does this code depend on?
- This code depends on several external packages including `bytes`, `fmt`, `github.com/cosmos/gogoproto/types`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/codec`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/crypto/types`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/kv`, and `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/slashing/types`.

3. What are the possible values that can be returned by the `NewDecodeStore` function?
- The `NewDecodeStore` function returns a closure that can return one of three possible string values depending on the key prefix of the `kv.Pair` arguments passed to it. The possible string values are: a formatted string containing two `types.ValidatorSigningInfo` values, a formatted string containing two `gogotypes.BoolValue` values, or a formatted string containing two `cryptotypes.PubKey` values. If the key prefix of the `kv.Pair` arguments does not match any of these three cases, the function will panic with an error message.
