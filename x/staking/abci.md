This code is a part of the staking module in the cosmos-sdk project. The staking module is responsible for managing the validator set and delegations in the Cosmos network. 

The `BeginBlocker` function is called at the beginning of every block and is responsible for persisting the current header and validator set as a historical entry. It also prunes the oldest entry based on the HistoricalEntries parameter. The `TrackHistoricalInfo` function is called from the `BeginBlocker` function and is responsible for tracking the historical information of the validator set. This information is used to calculate the rewards for validators and delegators.

Here is an example of how the `BeginBlocker` function can be used:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/staking/keeper"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/staking/types"
)

func main() {
    ctx := // create a new context
    k := keeper.NewKeeper() // create a new keeper

    BeginBlocker(ctx, k)
}
```

The `EndBlocker` function is called at the end of every block and is responsible for updating the validator set. It returns a list of `abci.ValidatorUpdate` which contains the updated validator set. The `BlockValidatorUpdates` function is called from the `EndBlocker` function and is responsible for updating the validator set.

Here is an example of how the `EndBlocker` function can be used:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cometbft/cometbft/abci/types"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/staking/keeper"
)

func main() {
    ctx := // create a new context
    k := keeper.NewKeeper() // create a new keeper

    EndBlocker(ctx, k)
}
```

In summary, this code is responsible for managing the validator set and delegations in the Cosmos network. The `BeginBlocker` function is called at the beginning of every block and is responsible for persisting the current header and validator set as a historical entry. The `EndBlocker` function is called at the end of every block and is responsible for updating the validator set.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BeginBlocker` function?
- The `BeginBlocker` function persists the current header and validator set as a historical entry and prunes the oldest entry based on the HistoricalEntries parameter.

2. What is the purpose of the `EndBlocker` function?
- The `EndBlocker` function is called every block to update the validator set.

3. What is the role of the `telemetry` package in this code?
- The `telemetry` package is used to measure the time taken by the `BeginBlocker` and `EndBlocker` functions and record it as a metric.
