The `v5` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to version 5 of the software development kit. This particular file defines a key prefix and a function for indexing historical information in the project.

The `HistoricalInfoKey` variable is a byte slice that serves as a prefix for the historical information stored in the project. This prefix is used to differentiate this type of data from other types of data stored in the project.

The `GetHistoricalInfoKey` function takes a height parameter, which is an integer representing the height of a block in the blockchain. This function converts the height to a byte slice using the `binary.BigEndian.PutUint64` method and appends it to the `HistoricalInfoKey` prefix. The resulting byte slice is returned as the key for indexing historical information objects.

This function is useful for retrieving historical information about the state of the blockchain at a particular height. For example, if a user wants to know the state of the blockchain at height 1000, they can use the `GetHistoricalInfoKey` function to generate the key for indexing the historical information object at that height. They can then use this key to retrieve the historical information and analyze the state of the blockchain at that point in time.

Here is an example usage of the `GetHistoricalInfoKey` function:

```
height := int64(1000)
key := GetHistoricalInfoKey(height)
// use key to retrieve historical information object at height 1000
```
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the HistoricalInfoKey variable?**
    
    The HistoricalInfoKey variable is a prefix used for indexing HistoricalInfo objects.

2. **What does the GetHistoricalInfoKey function do?**
    
    The GetHistoricalInfoKey function returns a key prefix for indexing HistoricalInfo objects based on the provided height parameter.

3. **What is the significance of using binary.BigEndian.PutUint64 in the GetHistoricalInfoKey function?**
    
    The binary.BigEndian.PutUint64 function is used to convert the height parameter from an int64 to a byte slice in big-endian byte order, which is required for proper indexing of HistoricalInfo objects.
