The `MigrateStore` function in the `v5` package of the `cosmos-sdk` project performs an in-place store migration from version 4 to version 5. The function takes two arguments: a `sdk.Context` and a `storetypes.StoreKey`. The `ctx` argument is used to access the key-value store, while the `storeKey` argument is the key of the store to be migrated. The function returns an error if the migration fails.

The `MigrateStore` function calls the `migrateHistoricalInfoKeys` function, which migrates the `HistoricalInfo` keys to binary format. The `HistoricalInfo` keys are stored in the key-value store with a prefix of `0x50`. The old key format is a string representation of the height in base 10, while the new key format is a byte array representation using big-endian byte order.

The `migrateHistoricalInfoKeys` function takes two arguments: a `storetypes.KVStore` and a `log.Logger`. The `store` argument is the key-value store to be migrated, while the `logger` argument is used to log any errors that occur during the migration.

The `migrateHistoricalInfoKeys` function iterates over the old key-value store using an iterator. For each key-value pair, the function extracts the height from the key, converts it to an integer, and generates a new key using the `GetHistoricalInfoKey` function. The new key is then set on the store, and the old key is deleted.

Overall, this code is responsible for migrating the key-value store from version 4 to version 5 of the `cosmos-sdk` project. The `MigrateStore` function is the entry point for the migration, while the `migrateHistoricalInfoKeys` function is responsible for migrating the `HistoricalInfo` keys to binary format. This code is an important part of the larger project as it ensures that the key-value store is compatible with the latest version of the `cosmos-sdk` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MigrateStore` function?
- The `MigrateStore` function performs in-place store migrations from v4 to v5.

2. What is the format of the old key and new key in the `migrateHistoricalInfoKeys` function?
- The old key is of format: prefix (0x50) || heightBytes (string representation of height in 10 base). The new key is of format: prefix (0x50) || heightBytes (byte array representation using big-endian byte order).

3. What does the `migrateHistoricalInfoKeys` function do?
- The `migrateHistoricalInfoKeys` function migrates HistoricalInfo keys to binary format by iterating through the old key-value store, parsing the height from the old key, creating a new key in binary format, and setting the new key on the store with the same value as the old key.
