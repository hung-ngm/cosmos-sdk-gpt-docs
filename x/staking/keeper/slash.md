The `keeper` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains the implementation of the `Keeper` struct, which is responsible for managing the state of the blockchain. This file contains functions related to slashing and jailing validators in the staking module.

The `Slash` function is used to slash a validator for an infraction committed at a known height. It finds the contributing stake at that height and burns the specified `slashFactor` of it, updating unbonding delegations and redelegations appropriately. The function takes in the context, the validator's consensus address, the height of the infraction, the power of the validator at the time of the infraction, and the `slashFactor`. The function returns the amount of tokens that were burned.

The `Jail` function is used to jail a validator. It takes in the context and the validator's consensus address.

The `Unjail` function is used to unjail a validator. It takes in the context and the validator's consensus address.

The `SlashUnbondingDelegation` function is used to slash an unbonding delegation and update the pool. It returns the amount that would have been slashed assuming the unbonding delegation had enough stake to slash. The function takes in the context, the unbonding delegation, the height of the infraction, and the `slashFactor`.

The `SlashRedelegation` function is used to slash a redelegation and update the pool. It returns the amount that would have been slashed assuming the redelegation had enough stake to slash. The function takes in the context, the source validator, the redelegation, the height of the infraction, and the `slashFactor`.

All of these functions are used to maintain the security of the blockchain by punishing validators who commit infractions. They are called by other functions in the staking module and are not meant to be called directly by external applications.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Slash` function and what are the contracts that it follows?
- The `Slash` function is used to slash a validator for an infraction committed at a known height. It finds the contributing stake at that height and burns the specified slashFactor of it, updating unbonding delegations and redelegations appropriately. The function follows several contracts, including that the slashFactor is non-negative, the infraction was committed equal to or less than an unbonding period in the past, and the infraction was committed at the current height or at a past height, not at a height in the future.

2. What is the purpose of the `SlashUnbondingDelegation` function and how does it work?
- The `SlashUnbondingDelegation` function is used to slash an unbonding delegation and update the pool. It returns the amount that would have been slashed assuming the unbonding delegation had enough stake to slash. The function performs slashing on all entries within the unbonding delegation, calculating the slash amount proportional to stake contributing to the infraction. It then updates the unbonding delegation if necessary and returns the total slash amount.

3. What is the purpose of the `SlashRedelegation` function and how does it work?
- The `SlashRedelegation` function is used to slash a redelegation and update the pool. It returns the amount that would have been slashed assuming the redelegation had enough stake to slash. The function performs slashing on all entries within the redelegation, calculating the slash amount proportional to stake contributing to the infraction. It then unbonds from the target validator and burns tokens from the destination-validator's bonding status. Finally, it returns the total slash amount.
