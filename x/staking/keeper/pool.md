The code above is part of the `keeper` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project. It contains functions that are used to manage the bonded and not bonded token pools within the staking module. 

The `GetBondedPool` function returns the bonded tokens pool's module account, while the `GetNotBondedPool` function returns the not bonded tokens pool's module account. These functions are used to retrieve the module accounts for the bonded and not bonded token pools respectively.

The `bondedTokensToNotBonded` function transfers coins from the bonded to the not bonded pool within staking. It takes in the context and the number of tokens to be transferred as input. The `notBondedTokensToBonded` function transfers coins from the not bonded to the bonded pool within staking. It takes in the context and the number of tokens to be transferred as input. These functions are used to move tokens between the bonded and not bonded pools.

The `burnBondedTokens` function removes coins from the bonded pool module account. It takes in the context and the number of tokens to be removed as input. The `burnNotBondedTokens` function removes coins from the not bonded pool module account. It takes in the context and the number of tokens to be removed as input. These functions are used to burn tokens from the bonded and not bonded pools respectively.

The `TotalBondedTokens` function returns the total staking tokens supply which is bonded. It takes in the context as input and returns the total number of bonded tokens. The `StakingTokenSupply` function returns the staking tokens from the total supply. It takes in the context as input and returns the total number of staking tokens. The `BondedRatio` function returns the fraction of the staking tokens which are currently bonded. It takes in the context as input and returns the bonded ratio.

These functions are used to manage the bonded and not bonded token pools within the staking module. They are called by other functions within the staking module to move tokens between the bonded and not bonded pools, burn tokens from the pools, and retrieve information about the total number of bonded tokens, staking tokens, and bonded ratio.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `math` package import?
- A smart developer might wonder why the `math` package is being imported in this file. The `math` package is used to perform mathematical operations on integers and decimals.

2. What is the difference between the `GetBondedPool` and `GetNotBondedPool` functions?
- A smart developer might want to know the difference between these two functions. `GetBondedPool` returns the bonded tokens pool's module account, while `GetNotBondedPool` returns the not bonded tokens pool's module account.

3. What is the purpose of the `BurnCoins` function in the `burnBondedTokens` and `burnNotBondedTokens` functions?
- A smart developer might want to know why the `BurnCoins` function is being used in these functions. The `BurnCoins` function is used to remove coins from the bonded and not bonded pool module accounts.
