This file contains the implementation of the `Keeper` struct for the staking module of the Cosmos SDK. The `Keeper` struct provides methods to access and manipulate the staking module's state. 

The methods in this file provide access to various staking parameters such as the unbonding time, maximum number of validators, maximum number of simultaneous unbonding delegations or redelegations, number of historical info entries to persist in store, bondable coin denomination, minimum validator commission rate, and the amount of staking tokens required for 1 unit of consensus-engine power. 

The `SetParams` method allows the module's parameters to be set, while the `GetParams` method retrieves the current parameter values. 

These methods are used by other modules in the Cosmos SDK to interact with the staking module. For example, the governance module may use the `SetParams` method to propose changes to the staking module's parameters, which can then be voted on and approved by validators. Validators may use the `MaxValidators` method to determine the maximum number of validators that can be active at any given time. 

Here is an example of how the `MaxValidators` method can be used:

```
import (
    sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/staking/keeper"
)

func someFunc(ctx sdk.Context, k keeper.Keeper) {
    maxValidators := k.MaxValidators(ctx)
    // do something with maxValidators
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains functions related to the staking module parameters in the cosmos-sdk project.

2. What is the significance of the `UnbondingTime` function?
- The `UnbondingTime` function returns the time duration for unbonding, which is a parameter of the staking module.

3. Why is there a TODO comment in the `PowerReduction` function?
- The TODO comment suggests that the `PowerReduction` function might be turned into an on-chain parameter in the future, as discussed in an open issue on the cosmos-sdk project.
