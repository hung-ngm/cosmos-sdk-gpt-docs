The code provided is a part of the `cosmos-sdk` project and contains functions that register and run invariants for the staking module. The staking module is responsible for managing the validators and delegators in the Cosmos network. Validators are responsible for validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain, while delegators can delegate their tokens to validators to earn rewards.

The `RegisterInvariants` function registers all the staking invariants with the `sdk.InvariantRegistry`. An invariant is a condition that must always be true for the system to function correctly. The function takes two arguments, an `sdk.InvariantRegistry` and a `Keeper`. The `Keeper` is a struct that contains all the necessary methods to manage the staking module. The function registers four invariants, namely `ModuleAccountInvariants`, `NonNegativePowerInvariant`, `PositiveDelegationInvariant`, and `DelegatorSharesInvariant`.

The `AllInvariants` function runs all the registered invariants for the staking module. It takes a `Keeper` as an argument and returns an `sdk.Invariant`. The function runs all the invariants and returns a string and a boolean. The string contains the details of the invariant that failed, and the boolean indicates whether any of the invariants failed.

The `ModuleAccountInvariants` function checks that the bonded and notBonded ModuleAccounts pools reflect the tokens actively bonded and not bonded. It takes a `Keeper` as an argument and returns an `sdk.Invariant`. The function iterates through all the validators and unbonding delegations to calculate the total bonded and not bonded tokens. It then compares the calculated values with the values stored in the ModuleAccounts pools. If the values do not match, the function returns a string indicating the details of the invariant that failed and a boolean indicating that the invariant failed.

The `NonNegativePowerInvariant` function checks that all stored validators have greater than or equal to zero power. It takes a `Keeper` as an argument and returns an `sdk.Invariant`. The function iterates through all the validators and checks if their power is greater than or equal to zero. If any validator has negative power, the function returns a string indicating the details of the invariant that failed and a boolean indicating that the invariant failed.

The `PositiveDelegationInvariant` function checks that all stored delegations have greater than zero shares. It takes a `Keeper` as an argument and returns an `sdk.Invariant`. The function iterates through all the delegations and checks if their shares are greater than zero. If any delegation has zero or negative shares, the function returns a string indicating the details of the invariant that failed and a boolean indicating that the invariant failed.

The `DelegatorSharesInvariant` function checks whether all the delegator shares which persist in the delegator object add up to the correct total delegator shares amount stored in each validator. It takes a `Keeper` as an argument and returns an `sdk.Invariant`. The function iterates through all the delegations and validators to calculate the total delegation shares for each validator. It then compares the calculated values with the values stored in the validators. If the values do not match, the function returns a string indicating the details of the invariant that failed and a boolean indicating that the invariant failed.

In conclusion, the code provided contains functions that register and run invariants for the staking module in the Cosmos network. These invariants ensure that the staking module functions correctly and that the validators and delegators are managed properly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RegisterInvariants` function?
- The `RegisterInvariants` function registers all staking invariants to the provided `sdk.InvariantRegistry` using the provided `Keeper`.

2. What does the `NonNegativePowerInvariant` function check for?
