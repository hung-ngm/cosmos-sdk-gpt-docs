This file contains various types and functions related to querying staking information in the Cosmos SDK. It defines constants for the different query endpoints supported by the staking Querier, such as validators, delegations, and historical information. 

The file also defines several structs that represent the parameters for different types of queries. For example, `QueryDelegatorParams` represents the parameters for queries related to a specific delegator's delegations, unbonding delegations, and validators. Similarly, `QueryValidatorParams` represents the parameters for queries related to a specific validator's information, such as delegations and unbonding delegations. 

Each of these structs has a corresponding constructor function that takes in the necessary parameters and returns an instance of the struct. For example, `NewQueryDelegatorParams` takes in a `delegatorAddr` of type `sdk.AccAddress` and returns a `QueryDelegatorParams` struct with the `DelegatorAddr` field set to the input value. 

These types and functions are used throughout the Cosmos SDK to enable querying of staking-related information. For example, a developer building a staking application on the Cosmos SDK might use these types and functions to retrieve information about validators, delegations, and other staking-related data. 

Here is an example of how one might use the `NewQueryValidatorsParams` function to retrieve a list of validators with a specific status:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/staking/types"
)

func getValidatorsWithStatus(status string) ([]types.Validator, error) {
    queryParams := types.NewQueryValidatorsParams(1, 100, status)
    res, err := client.QueryValidators(queryParams)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return res.Validators, nil
}
```

In this example, `getValidatorsWithStatus` takes in a `status` string and uses `NewQueryValidatorsParams` to create a `QueryValidatorsParams` struct with the specified status and default values for `Page` and `Limit`. It then uses the `client.QueryValidators` function to retrieve a list of validators that match the specified parameters, and returns the list of validators or an error if the query fails.
