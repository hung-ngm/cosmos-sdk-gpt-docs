This file contains code related to historical information in the cosmos-sdk project. The `NewHistoricalInfo` function creates a new historical information struct from a header and a validator set. It first sorts the validator set before including it in the historical info. The `MustUnmarshalHistoricalInfo` function unmarshals historical info and panics if there is an error. The `UnmarshalHistoricalInfo` function unmarshals historical info and returns any error. The `ValidateBasic` function ensures that the historical info is not nil and sorted. The `Equal` function checks if the receiver is equal to the parameter. The `UnpackInterfaces` function implements the `UnpackInterfacesMessage.UnpackInterfaces` method.

The purpose of this code is to provide functionality related to historical information in the cosmos-sdk project. Historical information is used to keep track of past validator sets and headers. This information is important for security and consensus in the network. The `NewHistoricalInfo` function is used to create a new historical info struct from a header and a validator set. The `MustUnmarshalHistoricalInfo` and `UnmarshalHistoricalInfo` functions are used to unmarshal historical info. The `ValidateBasic` function is used to ensure that the historical info is valid. The `Equal` function is used to check if two historical info structs are equal. The `UnpackInterfaces` function is used to unpack interfaces in the historical info struct.

Example usage of this code includes creating and validating historical info in the cosmos-sdk project. For example, when a new block is added to the blockchain, a new historical info struct can be created using the header and validator set of the block. This historical info can then be validated using the `ValidateBasic` function to ensure that it is valid. The `Equal` function can be used to compare historical info structs to check if they are equal. Overall, this code provides important functionality related to historical information in the cosmos-sdk project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NewHistoricalInfo` function and how does it sort the `valSet` parameter?
- The `NewHistoricalInfo` function creates a historical information struct from a header and a validator set, and sorts the `valSet` parameter in the same way that CometBFT does using the `ValidatorsByVotingPower` function.

2. What is the difference between the `MustUnmarshalHistoricalInfo` and `UnmarshalHistoricalInfo` functions?
- The `MustUnmarshalHistoricalInfo` function unmarshals historical info and panics on error, while the `UnmarshalHistoricalInfo` function unmarshals historical info and returns any error.

3. What is the purpose of the `Equal` method for the `HistoricalInfo` struct?
- The `Equal` method checks if the receiver `HistoricalInfo` is equal to the parameter `HistoricalInfo` by comparing their headers and validator sets.
