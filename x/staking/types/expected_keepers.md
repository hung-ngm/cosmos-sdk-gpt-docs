This file defines several interfaces that are expected to be implemented by other modules in the cosmos-sdk project. These interfaces are used by the staking module to interact with other modules and perform various actions related to staking and delegation.

The `DistributionKeeper` interface defines methods for retrieving information about the distribution of rewards and fees. The `AccountKeeper` interface defines methods for managing accounts, including retrieving accounts, iterating over accounts, and getting module accounts. The `BankKeeper` interface defines methods for retrieving and managing account balances, including getting balances, sending coins between modules, and burning coins. The `ValidatorSet` interface defines methods for managing validators, including iterating over validators, getting a particular validator, and slashing a validator. The `DelegationSet` interface defines methods for managing delegations, including iterating over delegations and getting the validator set for which the delegation set is based upon.

In addition to these interfaces, the file also defines an interface for event hooks called `StakingHooks`. This interface is used to communicate between the staking module and other modules that need to take particular actions when validators or delegators change state. The `StakingHooksWrapper` struct is a wrapper for modules to inject `StakingHooks` using depinject.

Overall, this file provides a set of interfaces that other modules can implement to interact with the staking module and perform various actions related to staking and delegation. For example, the `BankKeeper` interface can be implemented by a module that manages a token or coin type, allowing the staking module to retrieve and manage balances of that token or coin type. Similarly, the `StakingHooks` interface can be implemented by a module that needs to take particular actions when validators or delegators change state, such as updating a user's voting power or rewards.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DistributionKeeper` interface?
- The `DistributionKeeper` interface defines the expected methods for a distribution keeper, including getting the community fee pool coins and validator outstanding rewards coins.

2. What is the difference between `GetAllBalances` and `GetBalance` methods in the `BankKeeper` interface?
- The `GetAllBalances` method in the `BankKeeper` interface retrieves all balances for a given account address, while the `GetBalance` method retrieves the balance for a specific denomination.

3. What is the purpose of the `StakingHooks` interface and its methods?
- The `StakingHooks` interface defines event hooks for staking validator object state changes, including validator creation, modification, and removal, delegation creation and modification, and unbonding initiation. These hooks can be utilized to communicate between the staking keeper and another keeper that must take particular actions when these state changes occur.
