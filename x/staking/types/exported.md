This file defines two interfaces, `DelegationI` and `ValidatorI`, which are used in the larger cosmos-sdk project to represent delegation bonds and validators in a delegated proof of stake system.

The `DelegationI` interface has three methods:
- `GetDelegatorAddr()` returns the delegator's account address for the bond.
- `GetValidatorAddr()` returns the validator's operator address.
- `GetShares()` returns the amount of the validator's shares held in this delegation.

The `ValidatorI` interface has several methods:
- `IsJailed()` returns a boolean indicating whether the validator is jailed.
- `GetMoniker()` returns the moniker of the validator.
- `GetStatus()` returns the status of the validator.
- `IsBonded()`, `IsUnbonded()`, and `IsUnbonding()` return booleans indicating whether the validator has a bonded, unbonded, or unbonding status, respectively.
- `GetOperator()` returns the operator address to receive/return validators coins.
- `ConsPubKey()` returns the validation consensus pubkey as a `cryptotypes.PubKey`.
- `TmConsPublicKey()` returns the validation consensus pubkey as a `cmtprotocrypto.PublicKey`.
- `GetConsAddr()` returns the validation consensus address as an `sdk.ConsAddress`.
- `GetTokens()` returns the validation tokens as a `math.Int`.
- `GetBondedTokens()` returns the validator's bonded tokens as a `math.Int`.
- `GetConsensusPower()` returns the validation power in CometBFT as an `int64`.
- `GetCommission()` returns the validator commission rate as a `math.LegacyDec`.
- `GetMinSelfDelegation()` returns the validator minimum self delegation as a `math.Int`.
- `GetDelegatorShares()` returns the total outstanding delegator shares as a `math.LegacyDec`.
- `TokensFromShares()`, `TokensFromSharesTruncated()`, and `TokensFromSharesRoundUp()` return the token worth of provided delegator shares as a `math.LegacyDec`.
- `SharesFromTokens()` and `SharesFromTokensTruncated()` return the shares worth of delegator's bond as a `sdk.Dec`.

These interfaces are used throughout the cosmos-sdk project to define and interact with delegation bonds and validators in a delegated proof of stake system. For example, the `staking` module in cosmos-sdk uses these interfaces to define and manage validators and delegations. By defining these interfaces, the cosmos-sdk project can ensure that different parts of the system interact with validators and delegations in a consistent way.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DelegationI` interface?
- The `DelegationI` interface defines the methods that must be implemented by a delegation bond in a delegated proof of stake system, including getting the delegator address, validator address, and amount of validator's shares held in the delegation.

2. What is the purpose of the `ValidatorI` interface?
- The `ValidatorI` interface defines the methods that must be implemented by a validator in a delegated proof of stake system, including getting the validator's status, tokens, consensus power, commission rate, and minimum self delegation.

3. What packages are imported in this file and why?
- This file imports the `math`, `github.com/cometbft/cometbft/proto/tendermint/crypto`, `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/crypto/types`, and `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types` packages. The `math` package is used for handling decimal calculations, while the other packages are used for handling various types and interfaces related to the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint.
