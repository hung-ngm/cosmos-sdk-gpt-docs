The code defines two constants, `NotBondedPoolName` and `BondedPoolName`, which are used as root names for pool module accounts in the larger cosmos-sdk project. These constants are used to identify the two types of pools that exist in the project: the not-bonded tokens pool and the bonded tokens pool.

The `NewPool` function creates a new instance of the `Pool` struct, which is used for queries in the project. The function takes two arguments, `notBonded` and `bonded`, which are of type `math.Int`. These arguments represent the amount of not-bonded and bonded tokens in the pool, respectively. The function returns a `Pool` struct with the `NotBondedTokens` and `BondedTokens` fields set to the values of the `notBonded` and `bonded` arguments, respectively.

This code is important in the larger cosmos-sdk project because it defines the structure and naming conventions for the pool module accounts. The `Pool` struct is used throughout the project to represent the state of the pool, and the `NewPool` function is used to create new instances of this struct. By defining these constants and functions, the code provides a standardized way of working with pool module accounts in the project, which makes it easier for developers to understand and work with the codebase.

Example usage:

```
import (
    "cosmossdk.io/types"
    "cosmossdk.io/math"
)

func main() {
    notBonded := math.NewInt(100)
    bonded := math.NewInt(200)
    pool := types.NewPool(notBonded, bonded)
    fmt.Println(pool.NotBondedTokens) // Output: 100
    fmt.Println(pool.BondedTokens) // Output: 200
}
```

In this example, we import the `types` package from the cosmos-sdk project and the `math` package, which is used to create instances of the `math.Int` type. We then create two `math.Int` instances, `notBonded` and `bonded`, with values of 100 and 200, respectively. We pass these instances to the `NewPool` function to create a new `Pool` instance, which we then print the values of the `NotBondedTokens` and `BondedTokens` fields to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `math` package import?
- A smart developer might ask why the `math` package is being imported in this file. It is possible that the `math` package is being used to perform mathematical operations in the `NewPool` function.

2. What is the `Pool` struct and how is it used?
- A smart developer might ask what the `Pool` struct represents and how it is used in the project. The `NewPool` function creates a new instance of the `Pool` struct that is used for queries.

3. What is the significance of the `NotBondedPoolName` and `BondedPoolName` constants?
- A smart developer might ask why the `NotBondedPoolName` and `BondedPoolName` constants are defined and what they are used for in the project. These constants are used as root names for pool module accounts.
