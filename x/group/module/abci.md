The `EndBlocker` function is a part of the `module` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project. This function is called at the end of every block and performs two main tasks: updating the `FinalTallyResult` of proposals and pruning expired proposals. 

The `ctx` parameter is of type `sdk.Context` and represents the current context of the blockchain. The `k` parameter is of type `keeper.Keeper` and is used to interact with the state of the blockchain. 

The first task of the `EndBlocker` function is to call the `TallyProposalsAtVPEnd` function of the `keeper` package. This function updates the `FinalTallyResult` of all proposals that have reached their voting end time. The `TallyProposalsAtVPEnd` function takes the current context as a parameter and returns an error if there is an issue updating the proposals. 

The second task of the `EndBlocker` function is to call the `PruneProposals` function of the `keeper` package. This function removes all expired proposals from the state of the blockchain. The `PruneProposals` function takes the current context as a parameter and returns an error if there is an issue pruning the proposals. 

Overall, the `EndBlocker` function is an important part of the `cosmos-sdk` project as it ensures that proposals are properly updated and expired proposals are removed from the state of the blockchain. 

Example usage of the `EndBlocker` function:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/group/keeper"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
)

func main() {
    ctx := types.Context{} // create a new context
    k := keeper.Keeper{} // create a new keeper
    err := EndBlocker(ctx, k) // call the EndBlocker function
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EndBlocker` function?
- The `EndBlocker` function is called at every block and updates proposal's `FinalTallyResult` and prunes expired proposals.

2. What is the role of the `keeper.Keeper` parameter in the `EndBlocker` function?
- The `keeper.Keeper` parameter is used to access the necessary functions and data from the `group` module's keeper.

3. What is the `sdk.Context` parameter used for in the `EndBlocker` function?
- The `sdk.Context` parameter is used to provide context for the function, including information about the current block and state of the blockchain.
