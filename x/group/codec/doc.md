The `codec` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides a singleton instance of Amino codec that is used to register any concrete type that can later be referenced inside a `MsgSubmitProposal` instance so that they can be (de)serialized properly. 

The purpose of this package is to provide a centralized location for registering Amino types, which are used for encoding and decoding data in the Cosmos SDK. By registering Amino types, the SDK can properly serialize and deserialize data when it is sent over the network or stored in the database.

To register Amino types, the `RegisterLegacyAminoCodec` function should be called within the `init` function of each module's `codec.go` file. For example:

```go
func init() {
    // ...

    RegisterLegacyAminoCodec(govcodec.Amino)
    RegisterLegacyAminoCodec(groupcodec.Amino)
}
```

The `codec` package is put inside this package and not the `x/gov/types` package in order to avoid any dependency cycle.

In summary, the `codec` package provides a centralized location for registering Amino types, which are used for encoding and decoding data in the Cosmos SDK. This package is an important part of the larger project as it ensures that data is properly serialized and deserialized throughout the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Amino codec singleton instance in this package?
- The Amino codec singleton instance should be used to register any concrete type that can later be referenced inside a MsgSubmitProposal instance so that they can be (de)serialized properly.

2. How should Amino types be registered within this codec?
- Amino types should be ideally registered inside this codec within the init function of each module's codec.go file using the RegisterLegacyAminoCodec function.

3. Why is the codec instance put inside this package and not the x/gov/types package?
- The codec instance is put inside this package and not the x/gov/types package in order to avoid any dependency cycle.
