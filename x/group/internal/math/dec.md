The `math` package provides helper functions for mathematical calculations and parsing for the group module in the Cosmos SDK project. The `Dec` struct is a wrapper around the `apd.Decimal` type that ensures safe usage by creating a new `apd.Decimal` for every operation instead of mutating the underlying `Decimal`. This is necessary because `apd` operations can mutate the underlying `Decimal`, and copying the `big.Int` structure can cause corruption when shared between `Decimal` instances. 

The `NewPositiveDecFromString` and `NewNonNegativeDecFromString` functions create a new `Dec` from a string and return an error if the resulting `Dec` is not positive or non-negative, respectively. The `NewDecFromString` function creates a new `Dec` from a string and returns an error if the resulting `Dec` is not a finite decimal. The `String` method returns the string representation of the `Dec`. The `NewDecFromInt64` function creates a new `Dec` from an `int64`. 

The `Add` and `Sub` methods return a new `Dec` with the result of adding or subtracting two `Dec` values, respectively, without mutating any argument. They also return an error if there is an overflow. The `Int64` method returns the `int64` representation of the `Dec`. The `Cmp` method compares two `Dec` values and returns an integer indicating their relationship. The `Equal` method compares two `Dec` values and returns a boolean indicating whether they are equal. The `IsNegative` and `IsPositive` methods return a boolean indicating whether the `Dec` is negative or positive, respectively. The `IsZero` method returns a boolean indicating whether the `Dec` is zero.

The `Add` function is a wrapper around the `Add` method that adds two `Dec` values and returns a new `Dec`. The `Quo` method returns a new `Dec` with the result of dividing one `Dec` by another, formatted as decimal128 with 34 digit precision, without mutating any argument. It also returns an error if there is an overflow. The `SubNonNegative` function subtracts the value of one `Dec` from another and returns the result with arbitrary precision. It returns an error if the result is negative.

Overall, the `math` package provides a set of helper functions and a wrapper struct around the `apd.Decimal` type that ensures safe usage in the group module of the Cosmos SDK project. These functions and methods can be used for mathematical calculations and parsing of decimal values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Dec` struct and why is it necessary?
- The `Dec` struct is a wrapper around `apd.Decimal` that ensures safe usage by creating a new `apd.Decimal` for every operation instead of mutating the underlying `Decimal`. This is necessary because using `apd.Decimal` directly can be unsafe due to the possibility of corruption when the `big.Int` structure is shared between `Decimal` instances.

2. What is the difference between `NewPositiveDecFromString` and `NewNonNegativeDecFromString`?
- `NewPositiveDecFromString` returns a `Dec` instance created from a string that represents a positive decimal number, while `NewNonNegativeDecFromString` returns a `Dec` instance created from a string that represents a non-negative decimal number. If the input string does not meet the expected criteria, an error is returned.

3. What is the purpose of the `SubNonNegative` function and what does it return?
- The `SubNonNegative` function subtracts the value of `y` from `x` and returns the result with arbitrary precision. It returns an error if the result is negative, indicating that the subtraction would result in a negative number, which is not allowed in this context.
