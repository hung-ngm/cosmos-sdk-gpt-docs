The `orm` package provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) layer for the Cosmos SDK. The `table` struct is the high-level object that provides storage mapper functionality. It stores persistent entities by a unique identifier called `RowID`. The `table` struct does not enforce uniqueness of the `RowID`, prefix uniqueness of keys, or optimize gas usage conditions. The caller must ensure that these things are handled. The `table` struct is private, so that only custom tables built on top of `table` can satisfy these requirements.

The `table` struct has several methods that allow for CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the stored entities. The `Create` method persists the given object under the `RowID` key, returning an `errors.ErrORMUniqueConstraint` if a value already exists at that key. The `Update` method updates the given object under the `RowID` key. It expects the key to exist already and fails with an `sdkerrors.ErrNotFound` otherwise. The `Set` method persists the given object under the `RowID` key. It does not check if the key already exists and overwrites the value if it does. The `Delete` method removes the object under the `RowID` key. It expects the key to exist already and fails with an `sdkerrors.ErrNotFound` otherwise. The `Has` method checks if a key exists. The `GetOne` method loads the object persisted for the given `RowID` into the `dest` parameter. If none exists or `rowID==nil`, then `sdkerrors.ErrNotFound` is returned instead.

The `table` struct also has methods for registering callback functions that are executed after an object is created and/or updated (`AddAfterSetInterceptor`) and after an object is deleted (`AddAfterDeleteInterceptor`). These methods allow for the creation and removal of secondary index keys.

The `table` struct has two methods for iterating over a domain of keys in ascending or descending order: `PrefixScan` and `ReversePrefixScan`. These methods return an iterator over a domain of keys in ascending or descending order. The `Export` method stores all the values in the table in the passed `ModelSlicePtr`. The `Import` method clears the table and initializes it from the given data interface. The data should be a slice of structs that implement `PrimaryKeyed`.

Overall, the `table` struct provides a high-level interface for storing and retrieving persistent entities in the Cosmos SDK. It allows for CRUD operations and the creation and removal of secondary index keys.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `table` struct and what are its limitations?
   
   The `table` struct is a high-level object for storage mapper functionality. It is used to persist entities under a unique identifier called `RowID`. However, it does not enforce uniqueness of the `RowID`, prefix uniqueness of keys, or optimize Gas usage conditions. The caller must ensure that these things are handled.

2. What is the purpose of the `AddAfterSetInterceptor` and `AddAfterDeleteInterceptor` methods?
   
   The `AddAfterSetInterceptor` method is used to register a callback function that is executed after an object is created and/or updated. The `AddAfterDeleteInterceptor` method is used to register a callback function that is executed after an object is deleted. These methods allow for additional logic to be executed after a table operation is performed.

3. What is the purpose of the `Export` and `Import` methods?
   
   The `Export` method is used to store all the values in the table in the passed `ModelSlicePtr`. The `Import` method is used to clear the table and initialize it from the given data interface. The provided data should be a slice of structs that implement `PrimaryKeyed`. These methods allow for the table data to be exported and imported for backup or migration purposes.
