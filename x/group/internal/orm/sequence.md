The `Sequence` type in this file is a persistent unique key generator based on a counter. It is used to generate unique IDs for various objects in the larger project. The `NewSequence` function creates a new instance of the `Sequence` type with a given prefix. The prefix is used to namespace the keys generated by this sequence.

The `NextVal` method increments the counter by one and persists the new value to the storage layer. It returns the new value. The `CurVal` method returns the current value of the counter without incrementing it. The `PeekNextVal` method returns the next value of the counter without incrementing it or persisting the new value. These methods are useful for generating IDs and checking the current state of the counter.

The `InitVal` method sets the start value for the sequence. It must be called only once on an empty database. Otherwise, an error is returned when the key exists. The given start value is stored as the current value. It is recommended to call this method only for a sequence start value other than `1` as the method consumes unnecessary gas otherwise. A scenario would be an import from genesis.

The `DecodeSequence` function converts the binary representation of a sequence value into a `uint64` value. The `EncodeSequence` function converts a `uint64` value into the binary representation. These functions are used to store and retrieve the sequence value from the storage layer.

Overall, this file provides a simple and efficient way to generate unique IDs for various objects in the larger project. It is used in conjunction with the storage layer to persist the state of the counter. The `Sequence` type can be customized with different prefixes to generate unique IDs for different types of objects. Here is an example usage of the `Sequence` type:

```
import (
    "cosmossdk.io/store"
    "cosmossdk.io/store/types"
    "cosmossdk.io/x/group/orm"
)

func main() {
    db := store.NewMemoryDB()
    store := store.NewKVStore(db)
    sequence := orm.NewSequence(0x2)
    sequence.InitVal(store, 100)
    id := sequence.NextVal(store)
    fmt.Println(id) // Output: 101
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Sequence` type and how is it used?
- The `Sequence` type is a persistent unique key generator based on a counter, and it is used to generate unique keys for data stored in the storage layer.
2. What is the purpose of the `InitVal` method and when should it be called?
- The `InitVal` method sets the start value for the sequence and should be called only once on an empty DB. It is recommended to call this method only for a sequence start value other than `1` as the method consumes unnecessary gas otherwise.
3. What is the purpose of the `PeekNextVal` method and how is it different from `NextVal`?
- The `PeekNextVal` method returns the current value of the sequence plus the increment step, but it is not persistent. In contrast, the `NextVal` method increments and persists the counter by one and returns the value.
