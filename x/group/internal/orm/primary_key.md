The `PrimaryKeyTable` struct provides simpler object-style ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) methods without passing database RowIDs. Entries are persisted and loaded with a reference to their unique primary key. This struct is part of the `cosmos-sdk` project and is located in the `orm` package. 

The `PrimaryKeyed` interface defines an object type that is aware of its immutable primary key. It has two functions: `PrimaryKeyFields()` and `proto.Message`. `PrimaryKeyFields()` returns the fields of the object that will make up the primary key. The `PrimaryKey()` function encodes and concatenates the fields to build the primary key. The primary key has to be unique within its domain so that not two with the same value can exist in the same table. This means `PrimaryKeyFields()` has to return a unique value for each object. 

The `NewPrimaryKeyTable()` function creates a new `PrimaryKeyTable`. It takes three parameters: `prefixData`, `model`, and `cdc`. `prefixData` is a byte array of length 2. `model` is an interface that defines the structure of the object. `cdc` is a codec that is used to encode and decode the object. 

The `Create()` function persists the given object under its primary key. It checks if the key already exists and may return an `ErrUniqueConstraint`. The `Update()` function updates the given object under the primary key. It expects the key to exist already and fails with an `ErrNotFound` otherwise. The `Set()` function persists the given object under the rowID key. It does not check if the key already exists and overwrites the value if it does. The `Delete()` function removes the object. It expects the primary key to exist already and fails with an `ErrNotFound` otherwise. 

The `Has()` function checks if a key exists. It always returns false on a nil or empty key. The `Contains()` function returns true when an object with the same type and primary key is persisted in this table. The `GetOne()` function loads the object persisted for the given primary key into the dest parameter. If none exists, `ErrNotFound` is returned instead. 

The `PrefixScan()` function returns an iterator over a domain of keys in ascending order. End is exclusive. Start is a MultiKeyIndex key or prefix. It must be less than end, or the iterator is invalid and an error is returned. The `ReversePrefixScan()` function returns an iterator over a domain of keys in descending order. End is exclusive. Start is a MultiKeyIndex key or prefix. It must be less than end, or the iterator is invalid and an error is returned. 

The `Export()` function stores all the values in the table in the passed `ModelSlicePtr`. The `Import()` function clears the table and initializes it from the given data interface{}. Data should be a slice of structs that implement `PrimaryKeyed`. 

Overall, the `PrimaryKeyTable` struct provides a simpler way to interact with the database by using the object's primary key instead of the database RowID. This makes it easier to persist and load objects.
