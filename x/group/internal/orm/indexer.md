The `orm` package provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) layer for the Cosmos SDK. This file contains the implementation of an `Indexer` type that manages the persistence of an index based on searchable keys and operations. The `Indexer` type has three methods: `OnCreate`, `OnDelete`, and `OnUpdate`, which respectively persist, remove, and rebuild the secondary index entries for an object. 

The `Indexer` type is initialized with an `IndexerFunc` function that creates one or multiple index keys for the source object. The `IndexerFunc` function takes an object as input and returns a slice of index keys. The `Indexer` type also has an `addFunc` function that is used to add the index keys to the store. The `addFunc` function is set to `multiKeyAddFunc` by default, which allows multiple entries for a key. 

The `NewIndexer` function returns an `Indexer` that supports multiple reference keys for an entity. The `NewUniqueIndexer` function returns an `Indexer` that requires exactly one reference key for an entity. The `NewUniqueIndexer` function takes a `UniqueIndexerFunc` function as input, which creates exactly one index key for the source object. 

The `Indexer` type has a `pruneEmptyKeys` function that drops any empty key from the `IndexerFunc` function returned. The `Indexer` type also has a `difference` function that returns the list of elements that are in one slice but not in another. 

Overall, the `Indexer` type provides a way to manage the persistence of an index based on searchable keys and operations. It can be used in the larger project to efficiently query and retrieve data from the store. 

Example usage:

```
indexerFunc := func(value interface{}) ([]interface{}, error) {
    // create index keys for the source object
}

indexer, err := NewIndexer(indexerFunc)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

err = indexer.OnCreate(store, rowID, value)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

err = indexer.OnDelete(store, rowID, value)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

err = indexer.OnUpdate(store, rowID, newValue, oldValue)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Indexer` struct and its associated functions?
- The `Indexer` struct manages the persistence of an index based on searchable keys and operations. Its associated functions `OnCreate`, `OnDelete`, and `OnUpdate` persist, remove, and rebuild secondary index entries for an object, respectively.

2. What is the difference between `IndexerFunc` and `UniqueIndexerFunc`?
- `IndexerFunc` creates one or multiple index keys for the source object, while `UniqueIndexerFunc` creates exactly one index key for the source object.

3. What is the purpose of the `pruneEmptyKeys` function?
- The `pruneEmptyKeys` function drops any empty key from the `IndexerFunc` returned by the input function.
