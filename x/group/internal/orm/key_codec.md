The `orm` package provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) layer for the Cosmos SDK. This file contains functions for building and manipulating keys used in the ORM layer.

The `buildKeyFromParts` function takes a slice of interface{} types and encodes and concatenates them into a single byte slice that can be used as a key. The parts can be of type []byte, string, or uint64. The function returns an error if any part is of a different type. The key parts, except the last part, are encoded according to specific rules. []byte is encoded with a single byte length prefix, strings are null-terminated, and integers are encoded using 8 byte big endian.

The `keyPartBytes` function is a helper function for `buildKeyFromParts` that encodes a single key part according to the rules described above.

The `AddLengthPrefix` function prefixes a byte array with its length as 8 bytes. It panics if the byte array is longer than 255 bytes.

The `NullTerminatedBytes` function converts a string to a byte array and null-terminates it.

The `stripRowID` function takes an index key and a secondary index key and returns the RowID from the index key based on the secondary index key type. It is the reverse operation to `buildKeyFromParts` for index keys where the first part is the encoded secondary index key and the second part is the RowID.

These functions are used throughout the ORM layer to build and manipulate keys for accessing and storing data in the database. For example, the `buildKeyFromParts` function is used to build keys for accessing rows in tables, and the `stripRowID` function is used to extract the RowID from an index key.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides functions for building and manipulating keys used in an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system.

2. What types of key parts are allowed in the buildKeyFromParts function?
- The buildKeyFromParts function allows key parts of type []byte, string, and uint64.

3. What happens if the length of the byte array passed to AddLengthPrefix is greater than 255 bytes?
- If the length of the byte array passed to AddLengthPrefix is greater than 255 bytes, the function will panic and return an error message indicating that a key part with an []byte of length greater than 255 bytes cannot be created.
