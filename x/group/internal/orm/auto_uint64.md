The `AutoUInt64Table` type in the `orm` package is a table type with an auto-incrementing ID. It is used to create, update, delete, and retrieve objects with a unique ID. The table is implemented as a wrapper around a `table` type, which is a generic table type that can be used with any type of ID. 

To create a new `AutoUInt64Table`, the `NewAutoUInt64Table` function is used. It takes a prefix for the data store, a prefix for the sequence, a model that implements the `proto.Message` interface, and a codec. It returns a new `AutoUInt64Table` and an error if there was a problem creating the table.

The `Create` method is used to create a new persistent object with an auto-generated uint64 primary key. It takes a key-value store and an object that implements the `proto.Message` interface. It returns the auto-generated ID and an error if there was a problem creating the object.

The `Update` method updates the given object under the rowID key. It expects the key to exist already and fails with an `ErrNotFound` otherwise. It takes a key-value store, a rowID, and a new value for the object. It returns an error if there was a problem updating the object.

The `Delete` method removes the object under the rowID key. It expects the key to exist already and fails with an `ErrNotFound` otherwise. It takes a key-value store and a rowID. It returns an error if there was a problem deleting the object.

The `Has` method checks if a rowID exists. It takes a key-value store and a rowID. It returns a boolean indicating whether the rowID exists.

The `GetOne` method loads the object persisted for the given rowID into the dest parameter. If none exists, `ErrNotFound` is returned instead. It takes a key-value store, a rowID, and a destination object that implements the `proto.Message` interface. It returns the raw rowID and an error if there was a problem getting the object.

The `PrefixScan` method returns an iterator over a domain of keys in ascending order. It takes a key-value store, a start key, and an end key. The start key is inclusive and the end key is exclusive. It returns an iterator and an error if there was a problem scanning the keys.

The `ReversePrefixScan` method returns an iterator over a domain of keys in descending order. It takes a key-value store, a start key, and an end key. The start key is inclusive and the end key is exclusive. It returns an iterator and an error if there was a problem scanning the keys.

The `Export` method stores all the values in the table in the passed `ModelSlicePtr` and returns the current value of the associated sequence. It takes a key-value store, a destination slice of models that implement the `PrimaryKeyed` interface, and returns the current value of the associated sequence and an error if there was a problem exporting the data.

The `Import` method clears the table and initializes it from the given data interface{}. It takes a key-value store, a data interface{} that should be a slice of structs that implement `PrimaryKeyed`, and a sequence value. It returns an error if there was a problem importing the data.

Overall, the `AutoUInt64Table` type provides a convenient way to create, update, delete, and retrieve objects with a unique ID. It also provides methods for scanning keys and exporting/importing data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AutoUInt64Table` struct and how is it used?
- The `AutoUInt64Table` struct is a table type with an auto-incrementing ID used for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving objects with a uint64 primary key. It is used to interact with a key-value store and encode/decode protocol buffer messages.

2. What is the purpose of the `PrefixScan` and `ReversePrefixScan` functions?
- The `PrefixScan` and `ReversePrefixScan` functions return an iterator over a domain of keys in ascending or descending order, respectively. They are used to iterate over a range of keys in a key-value store and retrieve objects that match a certain prefix.

3. What is the purpose of the `Export` and `Import` functions?
- The `Export` function stores all the values in the table in the passed `ModelSlicePtr` and returns the current value of the associated sequence. The `Import` function clears the table and initializes it from the given data interface, which should be a slice of structs that implement `PrimaryKeyed`. They are used to export and import data from a key-value store.
