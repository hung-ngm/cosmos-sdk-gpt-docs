This code defines two interfaces, `AccountKeeper` and `BankKeeper`, that are expected to be implemented by other modules in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project. 

The `AccountKeeper` interface defines four methods that are used to manage accounts within the system. The `NewAccount` method creates a new account with the next available account number, but does not save it to the store. The `GetAccount` method retrieves an account from the store based on its address. The `SetAccount` method saves an account to the store. Finally, the `RemoveAccount` method removes an account from the store. 

The `BankKeeper` interface defines a single method, `SpendableCoins`, which is used to retrieve the spendable balance of a given account. This method takes a context and an account address as arguments, and returns a `Coins` object representing the spendable balance of the account. 

These interfaces are designed to be implemented by other modules within the `cosmos-sdk` project, such as the `auth` and `bank` modules. By defining these interfaces, the `cosmos-sdk` project can ensure that different modules can interact with each other in a standardized way. For example, the `bank` module can use the `AccountKeeper` interface to create and manage accounts, while the `auth` module can use the `BankKeeper` interface to retrieve account balances. 

Here is an example of how the `SpendableCoins` method might be used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/bank"
)

func getBalance(address types.AccAddress) types.Coins {
    // create a new context
    ctx := types.Context{}

    // get a reference to the bank keeper
    bankKeeper := bank.NewKeeper(nil)

    // use the bank keeper to retrieve the spendable balance of the account
    return bankKeeper.SpendableCoins(ctx, address)
}
```

In this example, we create a new context and a reference to the `bank` module's `BankKeeper`. We then use the `SpendableCoins` method to retrieve the spendable balance of a given account, specified by its address. The method returns a `Coins` object representing the balance of the account.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AccountKeeper` interface?
- The `AccountKeeper` interface defines methods for creating, retrieving, setting, and removing accounts from the store.

2. What is the purpose of the `BankKeeper` interface?
- The `BankKeeper` interface defines a method for retrieving the spendable coins for a given account address.

3. What is the `sdk` package imported for?
- The `sdk` package is imported to use the `AccountI`, `AccAddress`, and `Coins` types in the interface definitions.
