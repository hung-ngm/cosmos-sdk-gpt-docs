The `feegrant` package contains code related to fee allowances for transactions in the Cosmos SDK. This specific file defines the `AllowedMsgAllowance` struct, which implements the `FeeAllowanceI` interface. This struct represents a filtered fee allowance that only allows certain types of messages to be included in transactions. 

The `AllowedMsgAllowance` struct has three fields: `Allowance`, `AllowedMessages`, and `gasCostPerIteration`. The `Allowance` field is an `Any` type that holds the actual fee allowance. The `AllowedMessages` field is a slice of strings that contains the message types that are allowed in transactions. The `gasCostPerIteration` field is a constant that represents the amount of gas consumed per iteration when checking if a message is allowed.

The `AllowedMsgAllowance` struct has several methods. The `UnpackInterfaces` method is used to unpack the `Allowance` field. The `NewAllowedMsgAllowance` method is used to create a new `AllowedMsgAllowance` struct with the given `FeeAllowanceI` and allowed messages. The `GetAllowance` method returns the actual fee allowance. The `SetAllowance` method sets the actual fee allowance. The `Accept` method checks if the given messages are allowed and if they have a valid expiry. The `allowedMsgsToMap` method converts the `AllowedMessages` slice to a map for faster lookup. The `allMsgTypesAllowed` method checks if all the given messages are allowed. The `ValidateBasic` method enforces basic sanity checks on the `AllowedMsgAllowance` struct. The `ExpiresAt` method returns the expiry time of the actual fee allowance.

Overall, the `AllowedMsgAllowance` struct is used to create a filtered fee allowance that only allows certain types of messages to be included in transactions. This can be useful in scenarios where certain types of messages are more expensive or require more gas to execute. By filtering out these messages, the fee allowance can be optimized to reduce costs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AllowedMsgAllowance` struct and how does it relate to the `FeeAllowanceI` interface?
- The `AllowedMsgAllowance` struct is a filtered fee allowance that only allows certain types of messages. It implements the `FeeAllowanceI` interface, which defines methods for getting and setting the fee allowance and checking if a fee is allowed.

2. What is the purpose of the `gasCostPerIteration` constant and how is it used in the code?
- The `gasCostPerIteration` constant is used to track the amount of gas consumed by the `allowedMsgsToMap` and `allMsgTypesAllowed` methods. It is currently set to 10, but its purpose is to be revisited once a proper gas fee framework is in place.

3. What is the purpose of the `UnpackInterfaces` method and how is it used in the code?
- The `UnpackInterfaces` method is used to unpack the `Allowance` field of the `AllowedMsgAllowance` struct, which is a `types.Any` type. It implements the `UnpackInterfacesMessage` interface, which defines a method for unpacking any nested protobuf messages that may be contained within the `Allowance` field.
