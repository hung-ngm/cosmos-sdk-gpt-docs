The code defines a set of functions that allow querying fee allowances granted by one account to another account. This functionality is part of the larger cosmos-sdk project, which is a framework for building blockchain applications. 

The `Allowance` function returns the fee allowance granted by one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). The function takes a `context` and a `QueryAllowanceRequest` as input and returns a `QueryAllowanceResponse` and an error. The function first checks if the request is valid and then converts the granter and grantee addresses from strings to bytes. It then retrieves the fee allowance from the store using the `GetAllowance` function and converts the allowance to a protobuf message. Finally, it returns the allowance as a `Grant` object in the `QueryAllowanceResponse`.

The `Allowances` function returns all the fee allowances granted to a given grantee. The function takes a `context` and a `QueryAllowancesRequest` as input and returns a `QueryAllowancesResponse` and an error. The function first checks if the request is valid and then converts the grantee address from a string to bytes. It then retrieves all the fee allowances from the store using the `Paginate` function and returns them as a list of `Grant` objects in the `QueryAllowancesResponse`.

The `AllowancesByGranter` function returns all the fee allowances granted by a given granter. The function takes a `context` and a `QueryAllowancesByGranterRequest` as input and returns a `QueryAllowancesByGranterResponse` and an error. The function first checks if the request is valid and then converts the granter address from a string to bytes. It then retrieves all the fee allowances from the store using the `GenericFilteredPaginate` function and returns them as a list of `Grant` objects in the `QueryAllowancesByGranterResponse`.

Overall, these functions provide a way to query fee allowances granted by one account to another account. This functionality is useful for building blockchain applications that require fee delegation or fee sharing between accounts.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `feegrant` package and how does it relate to the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `feegrant` package is used to manage fee allowances for accounts in the `cosmos-sdk` project. It is related to the `cosmos-sdk` project as it is imported and used in the `keeper` package.

2. What is the difference between the `Allowances` and `AllowancesByGranter` functions in the `Keeper` struct?
- The `Allowances` function returns all the allowances granted to a given grantee, while the `AllowancesByGranter` function returns all the allowances granted by a given granter.

3. What is the purpose of the `codectypes` package and how is it used in this code?
- The `codectypes` package is used to convert a message to an `Any` type, which can be used to store any protobuf message in a `cosmos-sdk` application. It is used in the `Allowance` function to convert the `feeAllowance` message to an `Any` type before returning it.
