The `Keeper` struct in this file manages the state of all fee grants and calculates approval. It requires a codec with all available allowances registered. The `NewKeeper` function creates a new fee grant Keeper. The `Logger` function returns a module-specific logger. The `GrantAllowance` function creates a new grant, checking for duplicate entries and creating the account if it is not in the account state. It then sets the grant in the store and emits an event. The `UpdateAllowance` function updates an existing grant and emits an event. The `revokeAllowance` function removes an existing grant and emits an event. The `GetAllowance` function returns the allowance between the granter and grantee, returning nil if there is none. The `IterateAllFeeAllowances` function iterates over all the grants in the store, calling a callback to get all data. The `UseGrantedFees` function tries to pay the given fee from the granter's account as requested by the grantee. If the fee allowance is accepted, it stores the updated state of the allowance. The `InitGenesis` function initializes the keeper from a previously validated GenesisState. The `ExportGenesis` function dumps the contents of the keeper into a serializable GenesisState. The `addToFeeAllowanceQueue` function adds the new key to the pruning queue. The `RemoveExpiredAllowances` function iterates grantsByExpiryQueue and deletes the expired grants. 

This code is part of the cosmos-sdk project and is used to manage fee grants. Fee grants allow one account to pay fees on behalf of another account. This is useful in situations where a user wants to allow another user to pay fees for them, such as in a multi-signature account. The Keeper manages the state of all fee grants and calculates approval. It allows for the creation, updating, and removal of grants, as well as the retrieval of allowances between granters and grantees. The Keeper also provides functions for iterating over all grants in the store and for using granted fees. The `InitGenesis` and `ExportGenesis` functions are used for initializing and exporting the state of the Keeper. The `addToFeeAllowanceQueue` and `RemoveExpiredAllowances` functions are used for pruning expired grants. Overall, this code is an important part of the cosmos-sdk project and allows for the management of fee grants, which is a crucial feature for many users.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Keeper` struct and what are its dependencies?
- The `Keeper` struct manages the state of all fee grants and calculates approval. Its dependencies are a binary codec, a key-value store service, and an account keeper for fee grants.

2. What is the `GrantAllowance` function responsible for and what are some of the checks it performs?
- The `GrantAllowance` function creates a new grant and performs a check for duplicate entries. It also creates an account if it does not exist in the account state, checks for expiration, and adds the new key to the pruning queue if the expiry is not nil.

3. What is the purpose of the `RemoveExpiredAllowances` function and how does it work?
- The `RemoveExpiredAllowances` function iterates through the `grantsByExpiryQueue` and deletes the expired grants. It does this by deleting the key-value pair in the store for the grant and the corresponding key in the pruning queue.
