The code above is a part of the cosmos-sdk project and it provides a command-line interface (CLI) for the feegrant module. The feegrant module is responsible for managing fee grants, which are a way for one account (the granter) to pay transaction fees on behalf of another account (the grantee). 

The `GetQueryCmd` function returns a Cobra command that groups all the query commands for the feegrant module. The `GetCmdQueryFeeGrant` function returns a Cobra command that queries the details of a single grant between a granter and a grantee. The `GetCmdQueryFeeGrantsByGrantee` function returns a Cobra command that queries all the grants for a grantee. The `GetCmdQueryFeeGrantsByGranter` function returns a Cobra command that queries all the grants issued by a granter.

All of these functions take an `address.Codec` as an argument, which is used to convert the granter and grantee addresses from strings to bytes. The `RunE` function of each command retrieves the client context from the command, creates a query client for the feegrant module, and sends a query to the module using the appropriate query function. The results are then printed to the console using the `PrintProto` function of the client context.

Here is an example of how to use the `GetCmdQueryFeeGrant` command:

```
$ cosmos-sdk query feegrant grant cosmos1granter cosmos1grantee
```

This command queries the details of the fee grant between the `cosmos1granter` and `cosmos1grantee` accounts.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way for users to query the feegrant module from the command line.
