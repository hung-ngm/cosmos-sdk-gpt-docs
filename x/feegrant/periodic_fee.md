The `feegrant` package contains the implementation of the `FeeAllowanceI` interface, which is used to define the rules for granting fee allowances to accounts. The `PeriodicAllowance` struct is a concrete implementation of the `FeeAllowanceI` interface, which allows an account to spend a certain amount of coins over a given period of time. 

The `Accept` method of the `PeriodicAllowance` struct is called when a fee payment is requested. It takes in the requested fee amount and a slice of messages, and returns a boolean indicating whether the fee payment should be accepted or not, as well as an error if applicable. The method first checks if the fee payment is within the allowed period, and if not, returns an error. It then deducts the requested fee amount from the remaining spendable amount for the current period, and checks if the limit for the current period or the absolute limit has been exceeded. If either limit has been exceeded, it returns an error. If there is an absolute limit, it also checks if the remaining spendable amount is zero, and if so, returns true to indicate that the fee payment should be accepted. 

The `tryResetPeriod` method is called by the `Accept` method to check if the current period has ended, and if so, reset the spendable amount for the next period. It first checks if the current block time is before the next reset time, and if so, returns without doing anything. Otherwise, it sets the spendable amount for the next period to the lesser of the period spend limit and the basic spend limit, and updates the reset time to the end of the next period. If the current block time is more than one period after the last reset time, it sets the reset time to one period after the current block time. 

The `ValidateBasic` method is called to validate the `PeriodicAllowance` struct. It first calls the `ValidateBasic` method of the `BasicAllowance` struct, which checks if the basic allowance is valid. It then checks if the period spend limit is valid and positive, if the spendable amount for the current period is not negative, if the period spend limit is a subset of the basic spend limit, and if the period duration is not negative. If any of these checks fail, it returns an error. 

The `ExpiresAt` method returns the expiration time of the allowance, if it exists. 

Overall, the `PeriodicAllowance` struct provides a way to grant an account a spendable amount of coins over a given period of time, with the ability to set both a period spend limit and an absolute spend limit. It is used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to define the rules for granting fee allowances to accounts.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PeriodicAllowance` struct and how is it used in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `PeriodicAllowance` struct is a fee allowance implementation that is used to determine whether or not to process a fee payment requested based on the current block timestamp and the fee amount. It is used in the `Keeper.UseGrantedFees` function to check if a fee payment should be accepted or rejected.

2. What is the significance of the `PeriodReset` field in the `PeriodicAllowance` struct and how is it updated?
- The `PeriodReset` field is used to determine when the current period for the fee allowance ends and a new one begins. It is updated in the `tryResetPeriod` function based on the current block timestamp and the `Period` field of the `PeriodicAllowance` struct.

3. What are some of the basic sanity checks that are enforced in the `ValidateBasic` function of the `PeriodicAllowance` struct?
- The `ValidateBasic` function enforces checks such as ensuring that the `PeriodSpendLimit` and `PeriodCanSpend` fields are valid and positive, that the `PeriodSpendLimit` can be subtracted from the `Basic.SpendLimit` field (if it exists) using the same coin types, and that the `Period` field is not negative.
