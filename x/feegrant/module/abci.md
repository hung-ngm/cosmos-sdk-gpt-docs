The code above is a function called `EndBlocker` that is part of the `module` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project. The purpose of this function is to remove expired fee allowances at the end of a block. 

The function takes two arguments: `ctx` of type `sdk.Context` and `k` of type `keeper.Keeper`. The `ctx` argument is a context object that contains information about the current block being processed. The `k` argument is an instance of the `keeper.Keeper` struct, which is responsible for managing fee allowances.

The function calls the `RemoveExpiredAllowances` method on the `k` object, passing in the `ctx` argument. This method removes any expired fee allowances from the state. If an error occurs during this process, the function panics.

This function is likely called by the `EndBlock` method in the `app` package, which is responsible for executing all end-of-block logic. By removing expired fee allowances at the end of a block, this function helps to ensure that the state of the system remains accurate and up-to-date.

Example usage:

```
import (
    "cosmossdk.io/x/feegrant/keeper"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/bank"
)

func EndBlock(ctx types.Context, k keeper.Keeper, bk bank.Keeper) {
    // Perform other end-of-block logic
    // ...
    
    // Remove expired fee allowances
    module.EndBlocker(ctx, k)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EndBlocker` function?
   - The `EndBlocker` function is responsible for removing expired allowances using the `RemoveExpiredAllowances` function from the `keeper` package.
2. What is the `ctx` parameter in the `EndBlocker` function?
   - The `ctx` parameter is of type `sdk.Context` and is used to provide context information for the function to execute properly.
3. What is the `panic` statement used for in the `EndBlocker` function?
   - The `panic` statement is used to halt the execution of the program and print the error message if there is an error returned from the `RemoveExpiredAllowances` function.
