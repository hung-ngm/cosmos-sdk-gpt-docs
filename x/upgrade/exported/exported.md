The `exported` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains various interfaces and types that are meant to be used by external packages. One such interface is `ProtocolVersionSetter`, which is defined in this file.

The purpose of this interface is to allow external packages to set the protocol version of a `BaseApp` instance. `BaseApp` is a core component of the `cosmos-sdk` project that provides a framework for building blockchain applications. It handles tasks such as routing messages, managing state, and executing transactions.

By implementing the `ProtocolVersionSetter` interface, `BaseApp` allows external packages to specify the protocol version that should be used when communicating with the application. This is important because different versions of the protocol may have different features or behaviors, and it is necessary to ensure that all parties are using the same version in order to avoid compatibility issues.

Here is an example of how this interface might be used:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/exported"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/baseapp"
)

type MyApplication struct {
    app *baseapp.BaseApp
}

func (a *MyApplication) SetProtocolVersion(version uint64) {
    a.app.SetProtocolVersion(version)
}
```

In this example, `MyApplication` is a custom application that is built using `BaseApp`. By implementing the `SetProtocolVersion` method from the `ProtocolVersionSetter` interface, it allows external packages to set the protocol version of the application.

Overall, the `ProtocolVersionSetter` interface is a small but important part of the `cosmos-sdk` project. It enables external packages to interact with `BaseApp` instances in a standardized way, ensuring that all parties are using the same version of the protocol.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `exported` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The purpose of the `exported` package is not clear from this code snippet alone. It only defines an interface called `ProtocolVersionSetter`.

2. What is the `BaseApp` mentioned in the comment for the `ProtocolVersionSetter` interface?
- The `BaseApp` is not defined in this code snippet, but it is likely a type or struct within the `cosmos-sdk` project that implements the `ProtocolVersionSetter` interface.

3. What does the `SetProtocolVersion` method do?
- The `SetProtocolVersion` method is not defined in this code snippet, but it is likely a method that sets the protocol version of the `BaseApp` or another object that implements the `ProtocolVersionSetter` interface.
