The `upgrade` package contains the `BeginBlocker` function, which is responsible for executing an upgrade plan at a specific block height. The function checks if there is a scheduled upgrade plan and if it is ready to be executed. If the current height is in the provided set of heights to skip, it will skip and clear the upgrade plan. If it is ready, it will execute it if the handler is installed, and panic/abort otherwise. If the plan is not ready, it will ensure the handler is not registered too early (and abort otherwise).

The purpose of this function is to ensure that the binary is switched exactly at the desired block, and to allow a migration to be executed if needed upon this switch (migration defined in the new binary). The `skipUpgradeHeightArray` is a set of block heights for which the upgrade must be skipped.

The function first checks if the binary is valid by verifying that there is a registered upgrade handler for the last applied upgrade. If there is no scheduled upgrade, or the plan is not ready, or the plan is ready and skip upgrade height is set for the current height, it will panic. If there is a pending upgrade, but it is not yet time, the function will make sure that the handler is not set already.

If the upgrade plan is ready to be executed, the function will check if the skip upgrade has been set for the current height. If it has been set, the function will clear the upgrade plan at the current height. If there is no upgrade handler for this upgrade name, the function will write the upgrade info to disk and panic. If there is an upgrade handler for this upgrade name, the function will apply the upgrade.

The `BuildUpgradeNeededMsg` function is used to print the message that notifies that an upgrade is needed.

This function is an important part of the cosmos-sdk project as it ensures that upgrades are executed at the correct block height and that the binary is valid. It also allows for migrations to be executed if needed upon the switch to a new binary.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BeginBlocker` function?
- The `BeginBlocker` function checks if there is a scheduled upgrade plan and executes it if it is ready, while ensuring that the binary is switched exactly at the desired block and allowing a migration to be executed if needed upon this switch.

2. What is the significance of the `DowngradeVerified` check?
- The `DowngradeVerified` check ensures that a valid binary is being used and that there is an upgrade handler registered for the last applied upgrade. It will panic if there is no upgrade handler registered for the last applied upgrade.

3. What is the purpose of the `BuildUpgradeNeededMsg` function?
- The `BuildUpgradeNeededMsg` function returns a message that notifies that an upgrade is needed, including the name of the upgrade plan, the due time, and the information about the upgrade.
