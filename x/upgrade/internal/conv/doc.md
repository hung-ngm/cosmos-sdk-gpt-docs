The `conv` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides internal functions for conversions and data manipulation. This package is used to convert data types and manipulate data within the larger project. 

One example of a function in this package is `Atoi`, which converts a string to an integer. This function takes a string as an input and returns an integer. Here is an example usage of the `Atoi` function:

```
import "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/conv"

func main() {
    str := "123"
    num := conv.Atoi(str)
    fmt.Println(num)
}
```

This code will output `123`, which is the integer representation of the string `"123"`. 

Another function in this package is `Itoa`, which converts an integer to a string. This function takes an integer as an input and returns a string. Here is an example usage of the `Itoa` function:

```
import "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/conv"

func main() {
    num := 123
    str := conv.Itoa(num)
    fmt.Println(str)
}
```

This code will output `"123"`, which is the string representation of the integer `123`. 

Overall, the `conv` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides useful functions for converting and manipulating data types within the larger project. These functions can be used to ensure that data is in the correct format for various operations and calculations.
