The `plan` package contains functionality related to upgrade plans for the Cosmos SDK. The `Info` struct is a special structure that represents the plan information as a JSON string. It contains a map of OS/architecture strings to URLs where the binary can be downloaded. The `BinaryDownloadURLMap` is a map of OS/architecture strings to URLs where the binary can be downloaded. 

The `ParseInfo` function parses the plan information string into a map of OS/arch strings to URL strings. If the plan information string is a URL, a GET request is made to it, and its response is parsed instead. The `ValidateFull` function does all possible validation of the `Info` struct. It checks that `Binaries.ValidateBasic()` doesn't return an error and `Binaries.CheckURLs(daemonName)` doesn't return an error. The `ValidateBasic` function does stateless validation of the `BinaryDownloadURLMap`. It validates that the map has at least one entry, all entry keys have the format "os/arch" or are "any", all entry values are valid URLs, and all URLs contain a checksum query parameter. The `CheckURLs` function checks that all entries have valid URLs that return expected data. The provided `daemonName` is the name of the executable file expected in all downloaded directories. 

This package is used to validate and download binaries for an upgrade plan. It can be used to ensure that the binaries are valid and can be downloaded before executing the upgrade plan. Below is an example of how this package can be used:

```
planInfo, err := ParseInfo(infoStr)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

if err := planInfo.ValidateFull(daemonName); err != nil {
    return err
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `plan` package?
- The `plan` package provides functionality for parsing and validating upgrade plans.

2. What is the `Info` struct used for?
- The `Info` struct is used to represent the special structure that the Plan.Info string can be (as json).

3. What is the purpose of the `ValidateFull` method?
- The `ValidateFull` method does all possible validation of the `Info` struct, including checking that `Binaries.ValidateBasic()` doesn't return an error and `Binaries.CheckURLs(daemonName)` doesn't return an error.
