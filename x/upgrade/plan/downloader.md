The `plan` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains functions that download and validate upgrades for a daemon. The `DownloadUpgrade` function downloads the upgrade from the provided URL and saves it to the specified directory. The URL must contain a checksum parameter that matches the downloaded file. If the URL is not an archive, the file is downloaded and saved to `{dstRoot}/bin/{daemonName}`. If the URL is an archive, it is downloaded and unpacked to `{dstRoot}`. If the archive does not contain a `/bin/{daemonName}` file, the function attempts to move `/{daemonName}` to `/bin/{daemonName}`. If the archive does not contain either `/bin/{daemonName}` or `/{daemonName}`, an error is returned. If the download is successful, the function ensures that `{dstRoot}/bin/{daemonName}` is a regular executable file.

The `downloadUpgradeAsArchive` function tries to download the given URL as an archive. The archive is unpacked and saved in `dstDir`. If the archive contains `/{daemonName}` and not `/bin/{daemonName}`, then `/{daemonName}` will be moved to `/bin/{daemonName}`. If the download is successful, the function ensures that `{dstDir}/bin/{daemonName}` is a regular executable file.

The `EnsureBinary` function checks that the given file exists as a regular file and is executable. An error is returned if the file does not exist, the path exists but is not a regular file, or the file exists but is not executable by all three of User, Group, and Other, and cannot be made executable.

The `DownloadURLWithChecksum` function gets the contents of the given URL, ensuring the checksum is correct. The URL must contain a checksum parameter that matches the file being downloaded. If there isn't an error, the content returned by the URL will be returned as a string. The function returns an error if the URL is not a URL or does not contain a checksum parameter, downloading the URL fails, the checksum does not match what is returned by the URL, the URL does not return a regular file, or the downloaded file is empty or only whitespace.

Overall, these functions provide a way to download and validate upgrades for a daemon in the `cosmos-sdk` project. They ensure that the downloaded file is valid and executable, and they provide an opinionated directory structure that corresponds with Cosmovisor requirements. Developers can use these functions to upgrade their daemons in a safe and reliable way.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DownloadUpgrade` function?
- The `DownloadUpgrade` function downloads the given URL into the provided directory and ensures it's valid. If the URL is not an archive, it is downloaded and saved to `{dstRoot}/bin/{daemonName}`. If the URL is an archive, it is downloaded and unpacked to `{dstRoot}`. 

2. What is the purpose of the `downloadUpgradeAsArchive` function?
- The `downloadUpgradeAsArchive` function tries to download the given URL as an archive. The archive is unpacked and saved in `dstDir`. If the archive contains `/{daemonName}` and not `/bin/{daemonName}`, then `/{daemonName}` will be moved to `/bin/{daemonName}`.

3. What is the purpose of the `EnsureBinary` function?
- The `EnsureBinary` function checks that the given file exists as a regular file and is executable. An error is returned if the file does not exist, the path exists but is not a regular file, or the file exists but is not executable by all three of User, Group, and Other, and cannot be made executable.
