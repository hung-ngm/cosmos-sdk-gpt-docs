This code file contains two functions that are used to create command-line interface (CLI) commands for submitting software upgrade proposals and canceling them. These commands are part of the larger cosmos-sdk project, which is a framework for building blockchain applications.

The `GetTxCmd` function returns a `cobra.Command` object that includes two subcommands: `NewCmdSubmitUpgradeProposal` and `NewCmdSubmitCancelUpgradeProposal`. These subcommands are used to submit a software upgrade proposal and cancel a previously submitted proposal, respectively. The `NewCmdSubmitUpgradeProposal` function takes in an `addresscodec.Codec` object and returns a `cobra.Command` object that represents the `software-upgrade` subcommand. This subcommand takes in a name for the upgrade, a height at which the upgrade must happen, and information about the upgrade plan, such as new version download URLs. The subcommand also includes flags for skipping validation of the upgrade info and specifying the name of the executable being upgraded. The `NewCmdSubmitCancelUpgradeProposal` function takes in an `addresscodec.Codec` object and returns a `cobra.Command` object that represents the `cancel-software-upgrade` subcommand. This subcommand cancels a previously submitted software upgrade proposal.

Both subcommands use the `cli.ReadGovPropFlags` function to read in proposal flags from the command-line interface. They also use the `tx.GenerateOrBroadcastTxCLI` function to generate and broadcast a transaction to the blockchain. The `NewCmdSubmitUpgradeProposal` function additionally uses the `plan.ParseInfo` function to parse the upgrade plan information and the `plan.Info.ValidateFull` function to validate the upgrade plan. The `NewCmdSubmitUpgradeProposal` function also uses the `types.MsgSoftwareUpgrade` message type to create a message for the software upgrade proposal, while the `NewCmdSubmitCancelUpgradeProposal` function uses the `types.MsgCancelUpgrade` message type to create a message for canceling a software upgrade proposal.

Overall, these functions provide a way for users to submit and cancel software upgrade proposals through the command-line interface. They are part of the larger cosmos-sdk project and can be used to build blockchain applications. Below is an example of how to use the `software-upgrade` subcommand:

```
$ cosmos-sdk tx upgrade software-upgrade my-upgrade --upgrade-height 1000 --upgrade-info "https://example.com/my-upgrade.tar.gz"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains transaction commands for submitting a software upgrade proposal and cancel proposal.

2. What are the dependencies of this code file?
- This code file imports packages from `cosmos-sdk`, `cosmossdk.io/core/address`, and `github.com/spf13/cobra`. It also imports modules from `cosmossdk.io/x/upgrade/plan` and `cosmossdk.io/x/upgrade/types`.

3. What is the role of `ac` parameter in the functions `GetTxCmd`, `NewCmdSubmitUpgradeProposal`, and `NewCmdSubmitCancelUpgradeProposal`?
- The `ac` parameter is an instance of `addresscodec.Codec` and is used to encode and decode addresses in the transaction commands.
