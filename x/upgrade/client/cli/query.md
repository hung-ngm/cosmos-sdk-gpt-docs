[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/upgrade/client/cli/query.go)

The code is a part of the cosmos-sdk project and is located in the `cli` package. The purpose of this code is to provide a command-line interface (CLI) for the upgrade module of the cosmos-sdk. The upgrade module is responsible for managing the upgrade process of the blockchain. The CLI provides a way for users to interact with the upgrade module and query information about the upgrade process.

The `GetQueryCmd` function returns the parent command for all x/upgrade CLI query commands. It adds three sub-commands to the parent command: `GetCurrentPlanCmd`, `GetAppliedPlanCmd`, and `GetModuleVersionsCmd`. These sub-commands are used to query information about the upgrade process.

The `GetCurrentPlanCmd` function returns the query upgrade plan command. It queries the currently scheduled upgrade plan, if one exists. It uses the `QueryCurrentPlan` function of the `types` package to query the upgrade plan. If no upgrade is scheduled, it returns an error. Otherwise, it prints the upgrade plan to the console.

The `GetAppliedPlanCmd` function returns information about the block at which a completed upgrade was applied. It takes an upgrade name as an argument and queries the header of the block at which the upgrade was applied. It uses the `QueryAppliedPlan` function of the `types` package to query the block header. If the upgrade was not found, it returns an error. Otherwise, it prints the block header to the console.

The `GetModuleVersionsCmd` function returns the module version list from state. It takes an optional module name as an argument and queries the list of module names and their respective consensus versions. It uses the `QueryModuleVersions` function of the `types` package to query the module versions. If no module versions are found, it returns an error. Otherwise, it prints the module versions to the console.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way for users to query information about the upgrade process of the blockchain. It can be used in the larger project to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the upgrade module. Here is an example of how to use the CLI to query the currently scheduled upgrade plan:

```
$ cosmos-sdk upgrade plan
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains functions that return CLI commands for querying information related to the upgrade module in the cosmos-sdk project.

2. What is the significance of the `GetCurrentPlanCmd` function?
- The `GetCurrentPlanCmd` function returns a CLI command that retrieves the currently scheduled upgrade plan, if one exists, and prints it to the console.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetAppliedPlanCmd` function?
- The `GetAppliedPlanCmd` function returns a CLI command that retrieves information about the block at which a completed upgrade was applied, given the name of the upgrade. This helps clients determine which binary was valid over a given range of blocks and provides context for past migrations.
