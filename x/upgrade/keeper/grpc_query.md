This file contains the implementation of the query server for the upgrade module in the cosmos-sdk project. The upgrade module is responsible for managing the upgrade process of the blockchain. The module allows for the proposal of a new version of the software and the execution of the upgrade process. The upgrade process is executed in two phases: the proposal phase and the execution phase. During the proposal phase, a new version of the software is proposed, and the validators vote on whether to upgrade or not. During the execution phase, the upgrade is executed, and the new version of the software is activated.

The code in this file implements the query server for the upgrade module. The query server provides an interface for querying the state of the upgrade module. The query server provides the following methods:

- CurrentPlan: This method returns the current upgrade plan. The upgrade plan contains information about the proposed upgrade, such as the name, height, and time of the upgrade.
- AppliedPlan: This method returns the height at which a particular upgrade was applied. The height is the block height at which the upgrade was executed.
- UpgradedConsensusState: This method returns the upgraded consensus state at a particular height. The consensus state is the state of the blockchain at a particular height.
- ModuleVersions: This method returns the versions of the modules in the blockchain. The method can return the versions of all modules or a specific module.
- Authority: This method returns the address of the account that is authorized to perform upgrades.

The query server is implemented using the gRPC framework. The methods take a context and a request object as input and return a response object and an error. The context is used to pass information such as the block height and the validator set. The request object contains the parameters for the query.

Example usage:

```
// create a new client connection
conn, err := grpc.Dial(address, grpc.WithInsecure())
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("did not connect: %v", err)
}
defer conn.Close()

// create a new client
client := types.NewQueryClient(conn)

// query the current upgrade plan
plan, err := client.CurrentPlan(context.Background(), &types.QueryCurrentPlanRequest{})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("could not query current plan: %v", err)
}
fmt.Println(plan)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this file and what does it contain?
- This file contains the implementation of various gRPC methods related to upgrades in the cosmos-sdk project, including querying the current upgrade plan, applied upgrade plan, upgraded consensus state, module versions, and authority.

2. What dependencies does this file have?
- This file imports various packages from the cosmos-sdk project, including types and types/errors, as well as a package called "errors" from the "cosmossdk.io" domain.

3. What is the purpose of the "nolint:staticcheck" comment in some of the methods?
- This comment is used to disable staticcheck linter warnings for specific lines of code. It is used in this file to suppress warnings related to the use of deprecated calls for compatibility reasons.
