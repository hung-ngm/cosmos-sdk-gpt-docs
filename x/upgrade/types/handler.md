The `types` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains a definition for the `UpgradeHandler` type. This type is used to specify the function that should be called when an upgrade is applied to the system. 

The `UpgradeHandler` function takes three arguments: a `sdk.Context` object, a `Plan` object, and a `VersionMap` object. The `sdk.Context` object provides access to the current state of the system, while the `Plan` object specifies the details of the upgrade that is being applied. The `VersionMap` object is a mapping of module names to their respective versions. 

The `UpgradeHandler` function is responsible for migrating the state of the system from the previous version to the new version. The `fromVM` argument specifies the version of each module that the system is currently running, while the `toVM` argument specifies the target version of each module after the upgrade is applied. The `UpgradeHandler` function is expected to perform any necessary migrations or other actions to bring the system up to the new version. 

The `UpgradeHandler` function is defined as a type so that it can be easily passed around and used by other parts of the system. For example, the `x/upgrade` module in the `cosmos-sdk` project uses the `UpgradeHandler` type to specify the function that should be called when an upgrade is applied. Other modules in the system can also use the `UpgradeHandler` type to define their own upgrade functions. 

Here is an example of how the `UpgradeHandler` type might be used in the `x/upgrade` module:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/module"
)

func MyUpgradeHandler(ctx types.Context, plan module.Plan, fromVM module.VersionMap) (module.VersionMap, error) {
    // Perform any necessary migrations or other actions to upgrade the system
    // to the new version specified in the `plan` argument.
    // Return a new `VersionMap` object that specifies the new version of each module.
    return module.VersionMap{}, nil
}

func init() {
    // Register the `MyUpgradeHandler` function as the upgrade handler for this module.
    module.RegisterUpgradeHandler("mymodule", MyUpgradeHandler)
}
```

In this example, the `MyUpgradeHandler` function is defined to perform any necessary migrations or other actions to upgrade the system to the new version specified in the `plan` argument. The function returns a new `VersionMap` object that specifies the new version of each module. The `init` function registers the `MyUpgradeHandler` function as the upgrade handler for the `mymodule` module.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UpgradeHandler` function?
- The `UpgradeHandler` function is called when an upgrade is applied and specifies the type of function to be called.

2. What is the `fromVM` parameter in the `UpgradeHandler` function?
- The `fromVM` parameter is a `VersionMap` of moduleName to fromVersion (unit64), where fromVersion denotes the version from which we should migrate the module.

3. Where can developers find more information about the `UpgradeHandler` function and its usage?
- Developers can refer to the `docs/core/upgrade.md` file for more information about the `UpgradeHandler` function and its usage.
