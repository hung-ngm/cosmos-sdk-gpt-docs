The `UpgradeStoreLoader` function is a utility function that prepares the `baseapp` with a fixed `StoreLoader` pattern. This function is useful for custom upgrade loading logic. The `baseapp` is a core component of the Cosmos SDK that provides a framework for building blockchain applications. The `StoreLoader` is responsible for loading and initializing the application's state from a persistent storage layer.

The `UpgradeStoreLoader` function takes two arguments: `upgradeHeight` and `storeUpgrades`. `upgradeHeight` is the height at which the upgrade is scheduled to occur, and `storeUpgrades` is a list of upgrades that need to be applied to the application's state. The function returns a `StoreLoader` function that can be used to load the application's state.

The `StoreLoader` function takes a `CommitMultiStore` object as an argument. The `CommitMultiStore` is a multi-store that allows multiple key-value stores to be committed atomically. The function first checks if the `upgradeHeight` matches the current commit version of the `CommitMultiStore`. If the versions match, the function checks if there are any upgrades that need to be applied. If there are upgrades, the function calls the `LoadLatestVersionAndUpgrade` method of the `CommitMultiStore` object to apply the upgrades. If there are no upgrades, the function returns without doing anything.

If the versions do not match, the function returns the default `StoreLoader` function provided by the `baseapp`. The default `StoreLoader` function loads the latest version of the application's state from the `CommitMultiStore`.

Here is an example of how the `UpgradeStoreLoader` function can be used:

```
import (
    "cosmossdk.io/store/types"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/baseapp"
)

func main() {
    // create a new CommitMultiStore
    cms := types.NewCommitMultiStore(db)

    // create a list of upgrades
    upgrades := &types.StoreUpgrades{
        Renamed: []types.StoreRename{
            {OldKey: []byte("oldKey"), NewKey: []byte("newKey")},
        },
        Deleted: []string{"deletedKey"},
        Added: []types.StoreAddition{
            {StoreKey: []byte("newKey"), Value: []byte("value")},
        },
    }

    // create a new StoreLoader using the UpgradeStoreLoader function
    storeLoader := UpgradeStoreLoader(10, upgrades)

    // load the application's state using the StoreLoader
    err := storeLoader(cms)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }

    // use the application's state
    ...
}
```

In this example, the `UpgradeStoreLoader` function is used to create a new `StoreLoader` that applies upgrades to the application's state at height 10. The `StoreLoader` is then used to load the application's state from a `CommitMultiStore`. If there are upgrades to be applied, the `StoreLoader` applies them before returning. If there are no upgrades, the `StoreLoader` returns without doing anything.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UpgradeStoreLoader` function?
- The `UpgradeStoreLoader` function is used to prepare `baseapp` with a fixed `StoreLoader` pattern, which is useful for custom upgrade loading logic.

2. What parameters does the `UpgradeStoreLoader` function take?
- The `UpgradeStoreLoader` function takes two parameters: `upgradeHeight` of type `int64` and `storeUpgrades` of type `storetypes.StoreUpgrades`.

3. What does the `UpgradeStoreLoader` function return?
- The `UpgradeStoreLoader` function returns a function of type `baseapp.StoreLoader`.
