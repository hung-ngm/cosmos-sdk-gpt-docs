This code defines two constants, `QueryCurrent` and `QueryApplied`, which are used as query endpoints in the upgrade Querier. The upgrade Querier is a module in the larger cosmos-sdk project that handles upgrades to the blockchain software. 

The `QueryCurrent` endpoint is used to retrieve information about the current version of the software, while the `QueryApplied` endpoint is used to retrieve information about a previously applied upgrade. These endpoints can be used by clients to query the state of the upgrade module and determine which version of the software is currently running.

Here is an example of how these endpoints might be used in the context of the larger cosmos-sdk project:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/upgrade/types"
)

func main() {
    // create a new upgrade Querier
    querier := types.NewQuerier()

    // query the current version of the software
    currentVersion, err := querier.Query(types.QueryCurrent)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }

    // query information about a previously applied upgrade
    upgradeInfo, err := querier.Query(types.QueryApplied)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }
}
```

Overall, this code provides a simple interface for querying information about upgrades to the blockchain software in the cosmos-sdk project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\
A smart developer might ask what this code is used for and how it fits into the overall functionality of the cosmos-sdk project. Based on the package name and constant names, it appears to define query endpoints related to upgrades.

2. **What parameters are required for each query endpoint?**\
A smart developer might ask what parameters are required for each query endpoint, such as whether they require any input or return any output. Without additional context, it is unclear what these endpoints do or how they are used.

3. **How are these query endpoints implemented and used within the cosmos-sdk project?**\
A smart developer might ask how these query endpoints are implemented and used within the cosmos-sdk project, such as whether they are called by other functions or modules. Additional documentation or code examples would be helpful in understanding the full scope of their functionality.
