This file contains code related to software upgrades in the cosmos-sdk project. Specifically, it defines two message types: `MsgSoftwareUpgrade` and `MsgCancelUpgrade`. These messages are used to initiate and cancel software upgrades, respectively.

The `MsgSoftwareUpgrade` message contains information about the upgrade, including the name, height at which it should occur, and the authority responsible for initiating the upgrade. The `MsgCancelUpgrade` message simply contains the authority responsible for cancelling the upgrade.

The code also includes implementations of two interfaces: `sdk.Msg` and `legacytx.LegacyMsg`. These interfaces are used to define the expected behavior of messages in the cosmos-sdk project. By implementing these interfaces, the `MsgSoftwareUpgrade` and `MsgCancelUpgrade` messages can be used in various parts of the project.

The `GetSignBytes` and `GetSigners` methods are also defined for each message type. These methods are used to generate the bytes that should be signed by the authority responsible for initiating or cancelling the upgrade, as well as to determine the expected signers for each message type.

Here is an example of how these message types might be used in the larger cosmos-sdk project:

```go
func initiateUpgrade(ctx sdk.Context, authority sdk.AccAddress, upgradeName string, height int64) error {
    msg := types.NewMsgSoftwareUpgrade(authority, upgradeName, height)
    err := msg.ValidateBasic()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    err = msg.Sign(ctx.ChainID(), authority)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    _, err = ctx.BroadcastMsg(msg)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return nil
}

func cancelUpgrade(ctx sdk.Context, authority sdk.AccAddress) error {
    msg := types.NewMsgCancelUpgrade(authority)
    err := msg.ValidateBasic()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    err = msg.Sign(ctx.ChainID(), authority)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    _, err = ctx.BroadcastMsg(msg)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return nil
}
```

In this example, the `initiateUpgrade` function creates a new `MsgSoftwareUpgrade` message with the given parameters, validates it, signs it with the given authority, and broadcasts it to the network. The `cancelUpgrade` function does the same thing, but with a `MsgCancelUpgrade` message instead. These functions could be called from various parts of the cosmos-sdk project to initiate or cancel software upgrades.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MsgSoftwareUpgrade` and `MsgCancelUpgrade` messages?
- These messages are used for software upgrades and cancelling upgrades in the Cosmos SDK.
2. What is the `LegacyMsg` interface and why is it being used here?
- The `LegacyMsg` interface is being used to support backwards compatibility with older versions of the Cosmos SDK that used a different message format.
3. What is the `GetSigners` function used for and how does it determine the expected signers?
- The `GetSigners` function returns the expected signers for a message, which in this case is determined by parsing the `Authority` field of the message and converting it to an `sdk.AccAddress`.
