This file is part of the types package, which is a reverse proxy that translates gRPC into RESTful JSON APIs. The code in this file registers HTTP handlers for the Query service to a runtime.ServeMux, which is a HTTP request multiplexer. The Query service is defined in the query.proto file located in the cosmos/consensus/v1 directory. 

The RegisterQueryHandlerServer function registers the HTTP handlers for the Query service to the runtime.ServeMux. It takes a context.Context, a pointer to a runtime.ServeMux, and a QueryServer interface as arguments. The QueryServer interface is defined in the query.pb.go file generated by the protoc compiler. The function handles GET requests to the /cosmos/consensus/v1/params endpoint by calling the local_request_Query_Params_0 function. The local_request_Query_Params_0 function takes a context.Context, a runtime.Marshaler, a QueryServer interface, an http.Request, and a map of path parameters as arguments. It returns a proto.Message, a runtime.ServerMetadata, and an error. The proto.Message is the response message returned by the Params method of the QueryServer interface. The runtime.ServerMetadata contains the header and trailer metadata returned by the Params method. The error is any error returned by the Params method.

The RegisterQueryHandlerFromEndpoint function is similar to the RegisterQueryHandlerServer function, but it automatically dials to an endpoint and closes the connection when the context.Context gets done. It takes a context.Context, a pointer to a runtime.ServeMux, a string endpoint, and an array of grpc.DialOption as arguments. It dials to the endpoint using the grpc.Dial function and registers the HTTP handlers for the Query service to the runtime.ServeMux using the RegisterQueryHandler function.

The RegisterQueryHandler function registers the HTTP handlers for the Query service to the runtime.ServeMux. It takes a context.Context, a pointer to a runtime.ServeMux, and a *grpc.ClientConn as arguments. The *grpc.ClientConn is used to create a new QueryClient interface, which is defined in the query.pb.go file generated by the protoc compiler. The function then calls the RegisterQueryHandlerClient function with the context.Context, the pointer to the runtime.ServeMux, and the QueryClient interface.

The RegisterQueryHandlerClient function registers the HTTP handlers for the Query service to the runtime.ServeMux. It takes a context.Context, a pointer to a runtime.ServeMux, and a QueryClient interface as arguments. The function handles GET requests to the /cosmos/consensus/v1/params endpoint by calling the request_Query_Params_0 function. The request_Query_Params_0 function takes a context.Context, a runtime.Marshaler, a QueryClient interface, an http.Request, and a map of path parameters as arguments. It returns a proto.Message, a runtime.ServerMetadata, and an error. The proto.Message is the response message returned by the Params method of the QueryClient interface. The runtime.ServerMetadata contains the header and trailer metadata returned by the Params method. The error is any error returned by the Params method.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file is a reverse proxy that translates gRPC into RESTful JSON APIs.

2. What is the difference between `RegisterQueryHandlerServer` and `RegisterQueryHandlerFromEndpoint`?
- `RegisterQueryHandlerServer` registers the http handlers for service Query to "mux" and calls `local_request_Query_Params_0` to handle the request. `RegisterQueryHandlerFromEndpoint` is the same as `RegisterQueryHandler` but automatically dials to "endpoint" and closes the connection when "ctx" gets done.

3. What is the purpose of the variables that are being suppressed?
- The purpose of the variables that are being suppressed is to avoid "imported and not used" errors.
