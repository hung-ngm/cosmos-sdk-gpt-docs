The `v2` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code for performing in-place store migrations from version `v0.40` to `v0.43`. The `MigrateStore` function is the main entry point for this package. It takes a `sdk.Context`, a `storetypes.StoreKey`, and a `codec.BinaryCodec` as input parameters. The `storeKey` parameter is used to retrieve the `KVStore` instance from the context. The `BinaryCodec` is used to serialize and deserialize data.

The `MigrateStore` function performs the following migrations:
- Change addresses to be length-prefixed.
- Change balances prefix to 1 byte.
- Change supply to be indexed by denom.
- Prune balances and supply with zero coins.

The `migrateBalanceKeys` function migrates the balances keys to cater for variable-length addresses. It iterates over the old balances store and creates a new key for each balance using the `CreatePrefixedAccountStoreKey` function. The new key is then set on the store, and the old key is deleted.

The `pruneZeroBalances` function removes the zero balance addresses from the balances store. It iterates over the balances store and deletes any key-value pair where the balance is zero.

The `migrateSupply` function migrates the supply to be stored by denom key instead of a single blob. It retrieves the old supply from the store, deletes the single key holding the whole blob, and adds a new key for each denom. It then iterates over the old supply and sets the new key on the store.

The `pruneZeroSupply` function removes zero balance denom from the supply store. It iterates over the supply store and deletes any key-value pair where the balance is zero.

The `CreatePrefixedAccountStoreKey` function returns the key for the given account and denomination. This method can be used when performing an ABCI query for the balance of an account.

Overall, the `v2` package provides a set of functions that can be used to migrate the store from version `v0.40` to `v0.43`. These functions are used by the `MigrateStore` function, which is called during the upgrade process. The package provides a way to handle variable-length addresses, change the balances prefix, index the supply by denom, and prune balances and supply with zero coins.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `migrateSupply` function?
- The `migrateSupply` function migrates the supply to be stored by denom key instead of a single blob, by adding a new key for each denom.

2. What is the purpose of the `MigrateStore` function?
- The `MigrateStore` function performs in-place store migrations from v0.40 to v0.43, including changing addresses to be length-prefixed, changing balances prefix to 1 byte, changing supply to be indexed by denom, and pruning balances & supply with zero coins.

3. What is the purpose of the `pruneZeroBalances` function?
- The `pruneZeroBalances` function removes the zero balance addresses from balances store.
