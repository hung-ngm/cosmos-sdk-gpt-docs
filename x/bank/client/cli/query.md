The code provided is a part of the cosmos-sdk project and is located in the `cli` package. This file contains functions that define the CLI commands for the `x/bank` module. The `x/bank` module is responsible for handling the token transfers between accounts in the Cosmos network. 

The `GetQueryCmd()` function returns a parent command for all the `x/bank` CLI query commands. The function `GetBalancesCmd()` defines a CLI command to query the total balance of an account or of a specific denomination. The function `GetSpendableBalancesCmd()` defines a CLI command to query the spendable balance of an account or of a specific denomination. The function `GetCmdQueryTotalSupply()` defines a CLI command to query the total supply of coins in the chain. The function `GetCmdDenomsMetadata()` defines a CLI command to query the client metadata for coin denominations. The function `GetCmdQuerySendEnabled()` defines a CLI command to query for send enabled entries.

All these functions use the `cobra` package to define the CLI commands. They also use the `client` and `flags` packages from the `cosmos-sdk` module to handle the CLI flags and pagination. The `sdk` package is used to handle the account addresses and balance denominations.

For example, the `GetBalancesCmd()` function defines a CLI command to query the total balance of an account or of a specific denomination. The command takes an account address as an argument and an optional `--denom` flag to specify the balance denomination. The command uses the `types.NewQueryAllBalancesRequest()` function to query the total balance of an account and the `types.NewQueryBalanceRequest()` function to query the balance of a specific denomination. The `--resolve-denom` flag is used to resolve the denomination to a human-readable form from metadata. The command also uses the `client.ReadPageRequest()` function to handle pagination.

In summary, this file contains functions that define the CLI commands for the `x/bank` module. These commands can be used to query the balance and supply of coins in the chain, as well as the client metadata for coin denominations. These commands use the `cobra`, `client`, `flags`, and `sdk` packages to handle the CLI flags, pagination, and account addresses.
