This file contains various functions and constants related to querying account balances and supply information in the Cosmos SDK. The `QueryBalance`, `QueryAllBalances`, `QueryTotalSupply`, and `QuerySupplyOf` constants define the different types of queries that can be made related to balances and supply.

The `NewQueryBalanceRequest` function creates a new instance of a `QueryBalanceRequest`, which is used to query the balance of a specific account address and denomination. It takes in an `sdk.AccAddress` and a string `denom` as arguments and returns a pointer to a `QueryBalanceRequest` struct.

The `NewQueryAllBalancesRequest` function creates a new instance of a `QueryAllBalancesRequest`, which is used to query all balances of a specific account address. It takes in an `sdk.AccAddress`, a `query.PageRequest`, and a boolean `resolveDenom` as arguments and returns a pointer to a `QueryAllBalancesRequest` struct.

The `NewQuerySpendableBalancesRequest` function creates a new instance of a `QuerySpendableBalancesRequest`, which is used to query the spendable balances of a specific account address. It takes in an `sdk.AccAddress` and a `query.PageRequest` as arguments and returns a pointer to a `QuerySpendableBalancesRequest` struct.

The `NewQuerySpendableBalanceByDenomRequest` function creates a new instance of a `QuerySpendableBalanceByDenomRequest`, which is used to query the spendable balance of a specific account address for a given denomination. It takes in an `sdk.AccAddress` and a string `denom` as arguments and returns a pointer to a `QuerySpendableBalanceByDenomRequest` struct.

The `QueryTotalSupplyParams` struct defines the parameters for querying the total supply of all denominations. The `NewQueryTotalSupplyParams` function creates a new instance of this struct with the given `page` and `limit` arguments.

The `QuerySupplyOfParams` struct defines the parameters for querying the total supply of a specific denomination. The `NewQuerySupplyOfParams` function creates a new instance of this struct with the given `denom` argument.

Overall, these functions and constants provide a way to query account balances and supply information in the Cosmos SDK. They can be used in conjunction with other SDK modules to build applications that require balance and supply information. For example, a wallet application could use these functions to display the balance of a user's account, or a blockchain explorer could use them to display the total supply of a particular denomination.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains functions and constants related to querying balances and supply of a currency in the Cosmos SDK.

2. What is the difference between QueryAllBalancesRequest and QuerySpendableBalancesRequest?
- QueryAllBalancesRequest returns all balances of an address, while QuerySpendableBalancesRequest returns only the spendable balances (balances that are not locked).

3. What is the purpose of QueryTotalSupplyParams and QuerySupplyOfParams?
- QueryTotalSupplyParams and QuerySupplyOfParams are used to define the parameters for querying the total supply and supply of a specific denomination, respectively.
