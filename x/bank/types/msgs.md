This file contains message types and functions related to sending and updating parameters in the Cosmos SDK. The `MsgSend` type represents a message to send coins from one account to another, while the `MsgMultiSend` type represents a message to send coins from multiple accounts to multiple recipients. The `MsgUpdateParams` type represents a message to update certain parameters in the system. The `MsgSetSendEnabled` type represents a message to set one or more `SendEnabled` entries.

The functions in this file are used to construct these messages and to implement the `sdk.Msg` and `legacytx.LegacyMsg` interfaces. These interfaces define the methods that must be implemented by any message type in the Cosmos SDK. The `GetSignBytes` method returns the raw bytes of the message that need to be signed by the expected signers. The `GetSigners` method returns the addresses of the expected signers.

For example, the `NewMsgSend` function takes in the sender's address, recipient's address, and the amount of coins to be sent, and returns a `MsgSend` message. The `GetSignBytes` method for this message type marshals the message into JSON format and sorts the resulting bytes. The `GetSigners` method returns the sender's address.

Similarly, the `NewMsgMultiSend` function takes in an input and a slice of outputs, and returns a `MsgMultiSend` message. The `GetSignBytes` and `GetSigners` methods for this message type are implemented similarly to `MsgSend`.

Overall, this file provides the necessary message types and functions for sending and updating parameters in the Cosmos SDK. These messages can be used in conjunction with other modules in the SDK to build decentralized applications.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NewMsgSend` function?
- The `NewMsgSend` function constructs a message to send coins from one account to another.

2. What is the purpose of the `MsgMultiSend` type?
- The `MsgMultiSend` type is used to construct an arbitrary multi-in, multi-out send message.

3. What is the purpose of the `MsgSetSendEnabled` type and `NewMsgSetSendEnabled` function?
- The `MsgSetSendEnabled` type and `NewMsgSetSendEnabled` function are used to construct a message to set one or more SendEnabled entries.
