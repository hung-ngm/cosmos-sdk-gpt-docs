The `decode` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code for decoding transactions in the Cosmos network. The `Decoder` struct contains the dependencies required for decoding transactions, and the `Options` struct is used to create a new `Decoder`. The `Decode` method of the `Decoder` struct decodes raw protobuf encoded transaction bytes into a `DecodedTx` struct. 

The `DecodedTx` struct contains the decoded transaction, its signers, and other flags. The `Messages` field contains the messages in the transaction, and the `Tx` field contains the transaction body, authentication information, and signatures. The `TxRaw` field contains the raw transaction bytes, and the `Signers` field contains the public keys of the signers. The `TxBodyHasUnknownNonCriticals` field is a boolean flag that indicates whether the transaction body contains unknown non-critical fields.

The `Decode` method first checks that the transaction bytes follow ADR-027, which is a specification for encoding transactions in the Cosmos network. It then unmarshals the transaction bytes into a `v1beta1.TxRaw` struct, which contains the raw transaction bytes, the transaction body bytes, the authentication information bytes, and the signatures. The method then unmarshals the transaction body bytes into a `v1beta1.TxBody` struct, which contains the messages in the transaction. It also unmarshals the authentication information bytes into a `v1beta1.AuthInfo` struct, which contains the public keys of the signers.

The method then unpacks each message in the transaction using the `anyutil.Unpack` method, which returns the message and the public keys of the signers. It also gets the public keys of the signers using the `signingCtx.GetSigners` method. Finally, it returns a `DecodedTx` struct containing the messages, transaction body, raw transaction bytes, signers, and the `TxBodyHasUnknownNonCriticals` flag.

This code is used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to decode transactions received by the network. It is an important part of the transaction processing pipeline, as it allows nodes to verify the authenticity of transactions and ensure that they follow the ADR-027 specification. Developers can use this code to build applications that interact with the Cosmos network and process transactions. For example, a developer building a wallet application could use this code to decode transactions received by the wallet and display the details of the transaction to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Decoder` struct and how is it used?
- The `Decoder` struct is used for decoding transactions and contains the dependencies required for decoding. It has a `Decode` method that takes in raw protobuf encoded transaction bytes and returns a `DecodedTx` struct.

2. What is the `RejectUnknownFieldsStrict` function and why is it used?
- The `RejectUnknownFieldsStrict` function is used to reject all unknown proto fields in the root `TxRaw`. It takes in the transaction bytes, the descriptor of the `TxRaw` proto message, and a file resolver, and returns an error if there are any unknown fields.

3. What is the purpose of the `DecodedTx` struct and what information does it contain?
- The `DecodedTx` struct contains the decoded transaction, its signers, and other flags. It has fields for the decoded messages, the original `TxRaw` and `TxBody`, the signers, and a flag indicating whether the `TxBody` has unknown non-critical fields.
