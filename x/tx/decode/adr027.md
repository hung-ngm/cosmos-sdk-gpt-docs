The `decode` package contains a function called `rejectNonADR027TxRaw` that checks whether a given byte slice follows the ADR-027 specification. This function is specifically designed to check the encoding of `TxRaw` messages, which are used in the Cosmos SDK to represent unsigned transactions. 

The ADR-027 specification defines a set of rules for encoding protocol buffer messages to ensure that they are as compact as possible. The `rejectNonADR027TxRaw` function checks that the byte slice follows two of these rules: 

1. Field numbers are in ascending order (1, 2, and potentially multiple 3s)
2. Varints are as short as possible

The function iterates over the byte slice and uses the `protowire` package to parse each field. It checks that each field has a wire type of `protowire.BytesType` and that its tag number is greater than or equal to the previous tag number. It also checks that the varint used to encode the length of the field is as short as possible. If any of these checks fail, the function returns an error.

This function is used in the Cosmos SDK to validate unsigned transactions before they are signed and broadcast to the network. By ensuring that transactions follow the ADR-027 specification, the SDK can guarantee that they are encoded as compactly as possible, which reduces the size of the transaction and the fees required to broadcast it. 

Example usage:

```go
import "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/codec"

txBytes := []byte{...} // raw bytes of unsigned transaction
err := codec.RejectNonADR027TxRaw(txBytes)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is ADR-027 and why is it relevant to this code?
- ADR-027 is a specific standard that this code is checking for compliance with when decoding TxRaw. It ensures that field numbers are in ascending order and varints are as short as possible.

2. What is the purpose of the `varintMinLength` function?
- The `varintMinLength` function calculates the minimum number of bytes necessary to encode an unsigned integer using varint encoding.

3. What happens if `txBytes` does not follow ADR-027?
- If `txBytes` does not follow ADR-027, the `rejectNonADR027TxRaw` function will return an error indicating that the field numbers are not in ascending order or that the varints are not as short as possible.
