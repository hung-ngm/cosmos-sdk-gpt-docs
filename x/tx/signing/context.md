The `signing` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code for signing operations. This file contains the `Context` struct, which is used for retrieving the list of signers from a message where signers are specified by the `cosmos.msg.v1.signer` protobuf option. It also contains the `ProtoFileResolver` interface, which is a `protodesc.Resolver` that allows iterating over all file descriptors. 

The `Context` struct contains several fields, including `fileResolver`, `typeResolver`, `addressCodec`, `validatorAddressCodec`, and `getSignersFuncs`. The `fileResolver` and `typeResolver` fields are used for resolving message descriptors and types, respectively. The `addressCodec` and `validatorAddressCodec` fields are used for converting addresses between strings and bytes. The `getSignersFuncs` field is a map that caches the `getSignersFunc` functions for each message descriptor.

The `Options` struct is used for creating a `Context` instance with the desired options. The `NewContext` function creates a new `Context` instance using the provided options. It returns an error if the `addressCodec` or `validatorAddressCodec` fields are nil.

The `getSignersFunc` function is used to retrieve the signers for a given message. The `makeGetSignersFunc` function creates a `getSignersFunc` function for a given message descriptor. It retrieves the `cosmos.msg.v1.signer` field names from the message descriptor and creates a list of `fieldGetters` functions that retrieve the signers from each field. The `getSignersFieldNames` function retrieves the `cosmos.msg.v1.signer` field names from a message descriptor. The `init` function performs a dry run of getting all message signers to pre-populate the `getSignersFuncs` cache.

The `getAddressCodec` function retrieves the address codec used for a given field. The `GetSigners` function retrieves the signers for a given message using the `getSignersFunc` function for the message descriptor. The `AddressCodec`, `ValidatorAddressCodec`, `FileResolver`, and `TypeResolver` functions return the respective fields of the `Context` struct.

Overall, this code provides functionality for retrieving the signers from a message using the `cosmos.msg.v1.signer` protobuf option. It is used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project for signing operations.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Context` struct and its associated functions?
- The `Context` struct is used for retrieving the list of signers from a message where signers are specified by the `cosmos.msg.v1.signer` protobuf option. The associated functions are used for creating a new `Context`, getting the signers for a given message, and returning the address codec, validator address codec, proto file resolver, and proto type resolver used by the `Context`.

2. What is the purpose of the `getSignersFunc` type and the `makeGetSignersFunc` function?
- The `getSignersFunc` type is a function type that takes a `proto.Message` and returns a slice of byte slices and an error. The `makeGetSignersFunc` function is used for creating a `getSignersFunc` function for a given message descriptor. The `getSignersFunc` function is used for getting the signers for a given message.

3. What is the purpose of the `init` function?
- The `init` function performs a dry run of getting all message signers. This has two benefits: it will error if any message has forgotten the `cosmos.msg.v1.signer` annotation, and it will pre-populate the `Context`'s internal cache for `getSignersFuncs` so that calling it in antehandlers will be faster.
