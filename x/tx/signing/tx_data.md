The `signing` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains a `TxData` struct that represents the necessary data about a transaction to generate sign bytes. The `TxData` struct has five fields: `Body`, `AuthInfo`, `BodyBytes`, `AuthInfoBytes`, and `BodyHasUnknownNonCriticals`.

The `Body` field is a pointer to a `TxBody` struct from the `txv1beta1` package. The `TxBody` struct contains the message and fee information for a transaction. The `AuthInfo` field is a pointer to an `AuthInfo` struct from the same package. The `AuthInfo` struct contains the signer information for a transaction.

The `BodyBytes` field is a byte array that represents the marshaled body bytes that will be part of the `TxRaw` struct. The `AuthInfoBytes` field is a byte array that represents the marshaled `AuthInfo` bytes that will be part of the `TxRaw` struct.

The `BodyHasUnknownNonCriticals` field is a boolean that should be set to true if the transaction has been decoded and found to have unknown non-critical fields. This is only needed for amino JSON signing.

This `TxData` struct is used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to facilitate transaction signing. It contains all the necessary data to generate sign bytes for a transaction, which is a crucial step in the transaction signing process. The `TxData` struct is used in conjunction with other packages and structs in the `cosmos-sdk` project to create and sign transactions.

Example usage of the `TxData` struct:

```
import (
    "cosmossdk.io/api/cosmos/tx/v1beta1"
    "cosmossdk.io/signing"
)

// create a new TxData struct
txData := signing.TxData{
    Body: &txv1beta1.TxBody{
        // set the message and fee information for the transaction
    },
    AuthInfo: &txv1beta1.AuthInfo{
        // set the signer information for the transaction
    },
    BodyBytes: []byte{},
    AuthInfoBytes: []byte{},
    BodyHasUnknownNonCriticals: false,
}

// use the TxData struct to generate sign bytes for the transaction
signBytes, err := txData.GetSignBytes()
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// sign the transaction with the sign bytes
signature, err := sign(signBytes)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// add the signature to the transaction
tx := createTx()
tx.Signatures = append(tx.Signatures, signature)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TxData` struct?
- The `TxData` struct is used to store the necessary data about a transaction that is needed to generate sign bytes.

2. What is the `txv1beta1` package used for?
- The `txv1beta1` package is imported to access the `TxBody` and `AuthInfo` types used in the `TxData` struct.

3. What is the purpose of the `BodyHasUnknownNonCriticals` field in the `TxData` struct?
- The `BodyHasUnknownNonCriticals` field should be set to true if the transaction has unknown non-critical fields and is only needed for amino JSON signing.
