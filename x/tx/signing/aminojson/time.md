The `aminojson` package contains functions for encoding and decoding Protobuf messages to and from JSON format using the Amino encoding scheme. This file specifically contains two functions for marshaling Protobuf messages that represent timestamps and durations to JSON format.

The `marshalTimestamp` function takes a Protobuf message and a writer as input and returns an error if the message does not contain the expected fields. It extracts the seconds and nanos fields from the message and constructs a `time.Time` object from them. It then formats the `time.Time` object as a string in either RFC3339 or RFC3339Nano format depending on whether the nanos field is zero or not. Finally, it writes the formatted string to the writer in JSON format.

The `marshalDuration` function takes a Protobuf message and a writer as input and returns an error if the message does not contain the expected fields or if the number of seconds exceeds the maximum value that can be represented as nanoseconds in an int64. It extracts the seconds and nanos fields from the message and calculates the total number of nanoseconds. It then writes the total number of nanoseconds as a string to the writer in JSON format.

These functions are used in the larger project to encode and decode Protobuf messages that contain timestamps and durations to and from JSON format using the Amino encoding scheme. This is useful for interoperability with other systems that use JSON as their primary data format. For example, a Cosmos SDK application that communicates with a web API that uses JSON can use these functions to encode and decode Protobuf messages that contain timestamps and durations in JSON format. 

Example usage:

```
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/codec"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
    "github.com/tendermint/tendermint/libs/json"
)

// define a Protobuf message that contains a timestamp and a duration
type MyMessage struct {
    Timestamp *types.Timestamp `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=timestamp,proto3" json:"timestamp,omitempty"`
    Duration  *types.Duration  `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=duration,proto3" json:"duration,omitempty"`
}

// create a new instance of the message
msg := &MyMessage{
    Timestamp: &types.Timestamp{
        Seconds: 1234567890,
        Nanos:   123456789,
    },
    Duration: &types.Duration{
        Seconds: 987654321,
        Nanos:   987654321,
    },
}

// create a new codec
c := codec.New()

// register the timestamp and duration types with the codec
c.RegisterConcrete(&types.Timestamp{}, "google.protobuf.Timestamp", nil)
c.RegisterConcrete(&types.Duration{}, "google.protobuf.Duration", nil)

// encode the message to JSON using the codec and amino encoding scheme
jsonBytes, err := c.MarshalJSON(msg)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

// print the JSON-encoded message
fmt.Println(string(jsonBytes))
// Output: {"timestamp":"2009-02-13T23:31:30.123456789Z","duration":"987654321987654321"}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code provides functions for marshaling protobuf messages to JSON format. Specifically, it includes functions for marshaling timestamps and durations.

2. What external packages or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the "google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect" package for working with protobuf messages, and the "time" package for working with timestamps.

3. What is the significance of the `MaxDurationSeconds` constant?
- The `MaxDurationSeconds` constant represents the maximum number of seconds that can be stored in an int64 when expressed as nanoseconds. This is important because the `marshalDuration` function encodes google.protobuf.Duration as a time.Duration, which is a 64-bit signed integer.
