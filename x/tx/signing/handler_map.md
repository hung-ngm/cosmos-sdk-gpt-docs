The `signing` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to transaction signing. This particular file defines a `HandlerMap` type that aggregates several sign mode handlers together for convenient generation of sign bytes based on sign mode.

The `HandlerMap` type has two fields: `signModeHandlers` and `modes`. `signModeHandlers` is a map that maps `signingv1beta1.SignMode` values to `SignModeHandler` values. `modes` is a slice that contains all the supported sign modes.

The `NewHandlerMap` function constructs a new `HandlerMap` object. It takes one or more `SignModeHandler` objects as arguments. For each `SignModeHandler`, it adds the handler to the `signModeHandlers` map and adds the handler's mode to the `modes` slice.

The `SupportedModes` method returns the `modes` slice, which contains all the supported sign modes.

The `GetSignBytes` method takes a `signMode` value, a `signerData` value, and a `txData` value as arguments. It looks up the `SignModeHandler` for the given `signMode` value in the `signModeHandlers` map. If the handler is found, it calls the handler's `GetSignBytes` method with the `ctx`, `signerData`, and `txData` arguments and returns the result. If the handler is not found, it returns an error.

This code is used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to provide a unified interface for generating sign bytes for different sign modes. It allows different sign mode handlers to be added to the `HandlerMap` object and used interchangeably. For example, the `HandlerMap` object could contain handlers for `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT`, `SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON`, and `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_IN_MEMORY`, among others. When a transaction needs to be signed, the appropriate sign mode can be selected and the `GetSignBytes` method can be called to generate the sign bytes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HandlerMap` struct?
- The `HandlerMap` struct aggregates several sign mode handlers together for convenient generation of sign bytes based on sign mode.

2. How are the supported modes determined for a `HandlerMap` instance?
- The supported modes are determined by calling the `SupportedModes()` method on a `HandlerMap` instance.

3. What does the `GetSignBytes()` method do?
- The `GetSignBytes()` method returns the sign bytes for the transaction for the requested mode, using the appropriate sign mode handler based on the provided sign mode.
