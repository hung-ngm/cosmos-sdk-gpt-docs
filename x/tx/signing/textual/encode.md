The `textual` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code for encoding and decoding structured text data. Specifically, this file defines functions and variables for encoding a struct containing an array of screens according to a CDDL (CBOR Data Definition Language) specification. 

The `encode` function takes an array of `Screen` structs and an `io.Writer` as input, and returns an error if the encoding fails. It creates a new CBOR array and appends the CBOR representation of each `Screen` struct to it. Then, it creates a new CBOR map with a single entry, where the key is the `screensKey` variable and the value is the CBOR array. Finally, it encodes the CBOR map to the `io.Writer`.

The `Screen` struct represents a screen in a user interface and has four optional fields: `Title`, `Content`, `Indent`, and `Expert`. The `Cbor` method of the `Screen` struct returns a CBOR map that represents the struct according to the CDDL specification. It checks each field of the struct and adds a new entry to the CBOR map if the field is not empty or zero. The keys of the CBOR map are defined by the `titleKey`, `contentKey`, `indentKey`, and `expertKey` variables.

This code can be used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project to encode and decode structured text data in a standardized way. For example, it may be used to encode and decode transaction signing data or user interface data. Other parts of the project can rely on this encoding and decoding format to ensure consistency and interoperability. 

Example usage:

```
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"fmt"
	"cosmossdk.io/x/tx/signing/textual"
)

func main() {
	screens := []textual.Screen{
		{Title: "Title 1", Content: "Content 1", Indent: 1, Expert: true},
		{Title: "Title 2", Content: "Content 2"},
	}
	var buf bytes.Buffer
	err := textual.encode(screens, &buf)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(buf.Bytes())
}
```

This example creates an array of two `Screen` structs, encodes them using the `encode` function, and prints the resulting CBOR bytes to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `textual` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `textual` package contains code related to encoding and decoding a struct containing an array of screens according to the CDDL.

2. What is the significance of the `screensKey` and `titleKey` variables?
- `screensKey` is a key used in the `SignDoc` struct, and `titleKey` is a key used in the `Screen` struct. They are both assigned a value of type `cbor.Uint` from the `internal/cbor` package.
 
3. What is the purpose of the `encode` function and how does it work?
- The `encode` function encodes a struct containing an array of screens according to the CDDL. It creates a new `cbor.Array` and appends each screen's `Cbor()` representation to it. It then creates a new `cbor.Map` with the `screensKey` and `cbor.Array` as its entries, and encodes it to the provided `io.Writer`.
