The `textual` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides functionality for generating transaction sign bytes in the `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL` mode. This mode is used to generate human-readable transaction representations that can be used for offline signing and verification. The `SignModeHandler` struct holds the configuration for dispatching to specific value renderers for `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL`. 

The `NewSignModeHandler` function returns a new `SignModeHandler` which generates sign bytes and provides value renderers. It takes a `SignModeOptions` struct as an argument, which contains options for the `CoinMetadataQuerier`, `FileResolver`, and `TypeResolver`. The `CoinMetadataQuerier` is a function that queries state for the coin denom metadata. The `FileResolver` and `TypeResolver` are used for resolving message descriptors and types respectively. 

The `SignModeHandler` struct has several methods for generating value renderers for different types of fields, such as scalars, integers, enums, and messages. It also has methods for getting the transaction sign bytes and initializing a desired message with the values of a given message. 

The `coerceToMessage` function is an utility function that initializes the given desired message with the values of the given message. It checks if the given message is a protov2 concrete message of the same type, and if so, initializes the desired message to the same pointer value. If the given message is a dynamicpb message, it checks that the names match and uses proto reflection to initialize the fields of the desired message. Otherwise, it throws an error. 

Overall, the `textual` package provides functionality for generating human-readable transaction representations for offline signing and verification. It is used in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project for handling transaction signing and verification.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SignModeHandler` struct and its associated functions?
- The `SignModeHandler` struct holds the configuration for dispatching to specific value renderers for `SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL`. Its associated functions provide value renderers for different types of fields, initialize the `scalars` and `messages` registry for custom scalar and message renderers, and generate sign bytes for a transaction.

2. What is the purpose of the `CoinMetadataQueryFn` type and where is it used?
- The `CoinMetadataQueryFn` type defines a function that queries state for the coin denom metadata. It is meant to be passed as an argument into `NewSignModeHandler` to be used as a `CoinMetadataQuerier` option.

3. What is the purpose of the `coerceToMessage` function and how is it used?
- The `coerceToMessage` function initializes the given `desiredMsg` (presented as a protov2 concrete message) with the values of `givenMsg`. It is used in the `GetSignBytes` function to initialize a `textualpb.TextualData` message with the values of `txData` and `signerData`.
