The `textual` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code for rendering and parsing Protobuf messages in a human-readable textual format. The `messageValueRenderer` type is responsible for rendering and parsing Protobuf messages. It implements the `ValueRenderer` interface, which defines methods for rendering and parsing Protobuf values.

The `NewMessageValueRenderer` function creates a new `messageValueRenderer` instance. It takes a `SignModeHandler` and a `protoreflect.MessageDescriptor` as arguments. The `SignModeHandler` is used to get the field value renderer for each field in the message. The `protoreflect.MessageDescriptor` describes the message type.

The `Format` method of `messageValueRenderer` takes a `protoreflect.Value` and returns a slice of `Screen`s. Each `Screen` represents a line of text in the rendered message. The `Format` method iterates over each field in the message and renders its value. If the field is a list, it either calls the `FormatRepeated` method of the field value renderer or formats each element of the list. The rendered screens are returned as a slice.

The `Parse` method of `messageValueRenderer` takes a slice of `Screen`s and returns a `protoreflect.Value`. It parses the screens and returns the corresponding Protobuf value. The `Parse` method iterates over each field in the message and parses its value. If the field is a list, it either calls the `ParseRepeated` method of the field value renderer or parses each element of the list.

The `toSentenceCase` function formats a field name in sentence case. It capitalizes the first letter of the name and replaces underscores with spaces.

The `getKind` function returns the kind of a field. If the field is a Protobuf message, it returns the message's name. Otherwise, it returns the Protobuf kind.

Overall, the `messageValueRenderer` type is an important part of the `textual` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project. It provides functionality for rendering and parsing Protobuf messages in a human-readable textual format. This is useful for debugging and testing purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is part of the `cosmos-sdk` project and is located in the `textual` package. It defines a `messageValueRenderer` type that implements the `ValueRenderer` interface, which is used to format and parse protocol buffer messages into human-readable text format.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports the `google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect` and `google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoregistry` packages from the `protobuf` module.

3. What is the format of the output produced by the `Format` method?
- The `Format` method returns a slice of `Screen` structs, which contain the formatted text output. The first `Screen` contains the header for the message, and subsequent `Screen`s contain the formatted values for each field in the message. The `Title` field of each `Screen` contains the name of the field, and the `Content` field contains the formatted value. If a field is a repeated field, then multiple `Screen`s will be returned for that field, one for each element in the list.
