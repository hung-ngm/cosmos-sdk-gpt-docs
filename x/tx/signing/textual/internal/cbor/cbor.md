The `cbor` package is a Go implementation of the CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) protocol, as defined in RFC 8948. The purpose of this package is to provide a way to encode simple data in a deterministic way. The package provides a set of types that implement the `Cbor` interface, which allows them to be encoded to a stream.

The package defines several constants that represent the major types of CBOR data, such as unsigned integers, negative integers, byte strings, text strings, arrays, maps, tagged data, and simple data. It also defines several functions that are used to encode CBOR data, such as `encodeFirstByte`, which encodes the first byte of a CBOR data item, and `encodePrefix`, which encodes the prefix of a CBOR data item.

The `Cbor` interface is implemented by several types, such as `Uint`, `Text`, `Array`, `Map`, and `Bool`. These types represent the various CBOR data types and provide methods to encode them to a stream. For example, the `Uint` type represents an unsigned integer and provides a `NewUint` function to create a new instance of the type. The `Text` type represents a text string and provides a `NewText` function to create a new instance of the type. The `Array` type represents an array of CBOR data items and provides an `Append` method to add new items to the array. The `Map` type represents a map of key/value pairs and provides an `Add` method to add new entries to the map. The `Bool` type represents a boolean value and provides a `NewBool` function to create a new instance of the type.

The `Map` type has a special encoding method that ensures that the map entries are sorted by their encoded keys in bytewise lexicographic order, as required by the CBOR specification. This ensures that the encoding of a map is deterministic, regardless of the order in which the entries were added to the map.

Overall, the `cbor` package provides a simple and efficient way to encode simple data in a deterministic way, which is useful for applications that require data to be transmitted or stored in a compact and efficient format.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code implements a subset of CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) to encode simple data in a deterministic way.

2. What types of data can be encoded using this code?
- This code can encode unsigned integers, text strings, arrays, maps, and booleans.

3. How does the code ensure deterministic encoding of map entries?
- The code sorts map entries by their encoded keys in bytewise lexicographic order to ensure deterministic encoding. Duplicate keys will cause an error when Encode is called.
