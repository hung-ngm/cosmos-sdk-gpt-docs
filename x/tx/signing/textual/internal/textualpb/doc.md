The `textualpb` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains all the protobuf definitions and generated codes that are used internally by Textual. The purpose of this package is to provide a standardized way of encoding and decoding data structures in a language-agnostic way. 

Protobuf is a language-agnostic data serialization format that is used to exchange data between different systems. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and extensible. Protobuf messages are defined using a simple language called Protocol Buffers Language (proto). These messages are then compiled into code in various programming languages, including Go, Java, Python, and C++. 

The `textualpb` package contains the protobuf definitions and generated code for the Textual module in the `cosmos-sdk` project. This module provides a way to interact with the blockchain using natural language commands. The protobuf messages defined in this package are used to encode and decode these natural language commands into a format that can be understood by the blockchain. 

For example, the `TextProposal` message defined in this package is used to encode a proposal for a new text command. This message contains fields for the title, description, and initial deposit required for the proposal. The `TextProposal` message is then serialized using protobuf and sent to the blockchain for processing. 

```go
message TextProposal {
  string title = 1;
  string description = 2;
  google.protobuf.Any initial_deposit = 3;
}
```

In summary, the `textualpb` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides a standardized way of encoding and decoding data structures using protobuf. This package is used internally by the Textual module to encode and decode natural language commands for the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is Textual and how does it use the protobuf definitions and generated codes in this package?
- This code is part of a package called textualpb, which contains protobuf definitions and generated codes used internally by Textual. A smart developer might want to know more about Textual and how it utilizes these definitions and codes.

2. Are there any dependencies or requirements for using this package?
- The code snippet does not provide information about any dependencies or requirements for using this package. A smart developer might want to know if there are any specific versions of protobuf or other libraries that need to be installed or configured.

3. Are there any other packages or modules that interact with this package?
- The code snippet does not provide information about any other packages or modules that interact with this package. A smart developer might want to know if there are any other parts of the cosmos-sdk project that rely on this package, or if there are any external libraries or services that use it.
