The `signing` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains an interface called `SignModeHandler`. This interface defines the methods that handlers for each sign mode should implement to generate sign bytes. 

The `SignModeHandler` interface has two methods: `Mode()` and `GetSignBytes()`. The `Mode()` method returns the sign mode supported by the handler. The `GetSignBytes()` method takes in three arguments: a context, `SignerData`, and `TxData`. It returns the sign bytes for the provided `SignerData` and `TxData`, or an error.

This interface is important because it allows for different sign modes to be supported in the `cosmos-sdk` project. By implementing this interface, developers can create custom sign mode handlers that generate sign bytes for their specific use case. 

For example, a developer could create a custom sign mode handler that generates sign bytes for a specific type of transaction. They would implement the `SignModeHandler` interface and define the `Mode()` and `GetSignBytes()` methods for their specific sign mode. Then, they could register their custom sign mode handler with the `cosmos-sdk` project, allowing it to be used in the signing process for transactions.

Overall, the `SignModeHandler` interface is a key component of the `cosmos-sdk` project's signing package, allowing for flexibility and customization in the signing process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `signingv1beta1` package imported in this file?
- The `signingv1beta1` package is imported to use the `SignMode` type in the `Mode()` method and the `SignerData` and `TxData` types in the `GetSignBytes()` method.

2. What is the `SignModeHandler` interface used for?
- The `SignModeHandler` interface is used to define the methods that handlers for each sign mode should implement to generate sign bytes.

3. What parameters are required for the `GetSignBytes()` method?
- The `GetSignBytes()` method requires a `context.Context` object, a `SignerData` object, and a `TxData` object as parameters, and returns a byte slice and an error.
