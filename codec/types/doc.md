The `types` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project defines a custom wrapper for `google.protobuf.Any` that supports cached values and an `InterfaceRegistry` that keeps track of types that can be used with `Any` for both security and introspection purposes. 

The `google.protobuf.Any` type is a message that can contain any serialized protocol buffer message along with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message. The `types` package provides a wrapper around this type that allows for caching of values and type introspection.

The `CachedAny` type is a wrapper around `google.protobuf.Any` that caches the decoded value of the message. This can be useful in situations where the same message is being decoded multiple times, as it can save on processing time. The `CachedAny` type also provides a method for getting the type URL of the wrapped message.

The `InterfaceRegistry` type is used to keep track of types that can be used with `Any` for both security and introspection purposes. It provides methods for registering and retrieving types, as well as checking if a type is registered. This can be useful in situations where a message needs to be validated before being decoded, or when the type of a message needs to be determined at runtime.

Overall, the `types` package provides a useful set of tools for working with `google.protobuf.Any` messages in a more efficient and secure manner. Here is an example of how the `CachedAny` type can be used:

```go
import (
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
    "google.golang.org/protobuf/proto"
)

func decodeMessage(any *types.CachedAny) (proto.Message, error) {
    // Get the cached value of the message
    value, err := any.GetCachedValue()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Cast the value to a proto.Message
    message, ok := value.(proto.Message)
    if !ok {
        return nil, errors.New("cached value is not a proto.Message")
    }

    return message, nil
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InterfaceRegistry` in this package?
   - The `InterfaceRegistry` keeps track of types that can be used with `google.protobuf.Any` for both security and introspection.

2. How does this package support cached values?
   - This package defines a custom wrapper for `google.protobuf.Any` which supports cached values.

3. What is the main functionality provided by this package?
   - This package defines a custom wrapper for `google.protobuf.Any` which supports cached values and an `InterfaceRegistry` for tracking types that can be used with `Any`.
