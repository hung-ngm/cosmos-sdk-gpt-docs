The `codec` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides an implementation of a codec that utilizes Protobuf for both binary and JSON encoding. This package contains the `ProtoCodec` type, which implements the `Codec` interface and the `ProtoCodecMarshaler` interface. The `ProtoCodec` type is responsible for encoding and decoding Protobuf messages to and from binary and JSON formats.

The `ProtoCodec` type has several methods that implement the `BinaryMarshaler` and `JSONCodec` interfaces. These methods include `Marshal`, `MustMarshal`, `MarshalLengthPrefixed`, `MustMarshalLengthPrefixed`, `Unmarshal`, `MustUnmarshal`, `UnmarshalLengthPrefixed`, `MustUnmarshalLengthPrefixed`, `MarshalJSON`, `MustMarshalJSON`, `UnmarshalJSON`, and `MustUnmarshalJSON`. These methods are used to encode and decode Protobuf messages to and from binary and JSON formats.

The `ProtoCodec` type also has methods that implement the `AnyUnpacker` interface. These methods include `UnpackAny` and `GetMsgAnySigners`. These methods are used to unpack `Any` messages and retrieve the signers of a message.

The `ProtoCodec` type also has a method that returns the `InterfaceRegistry` used by the codec. This method is called `InterfaceRegistry`.

The `NewProtoCodec` function returns a new instance of the `ProtoCodec` type. It takes an `InterfaceRegistry` as an argument and returns a pointer to a new `ProtoCodec` instance.

Overall, the `ProtoCodec` type is an important part of the `cosmos-sdk` project as it provides an implementation of a codec that utilizes Protobuf for both binary and JSON encoding. This codec is used to encode and decode Protobuf messages to and from binary and JSON formats in various parts of the `cosmos-sdk` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProtoCodec` struct?
- The `ProtoCodec` struct defines a codec that utilizes Protobuf for both binary and JSON encoding.

2. What is the purpose of the `InterfaceRegistry` method?
- The `InterfaceRegistry` method returns the `InterfaceRegistry` associated with the `ProtoCodec`.

3. What is the purpose of the `GRPCCodec` method?
- The `GRPCCodec` method returns the gRPC Codec for this specific `ProtoCodec`.
