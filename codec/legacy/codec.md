This file defines a global codec variable `Cdc` that is used throughout the cosmos-sdk project. The `Cdc` variable is a legacy Amino codec that has all CometBFT crypto and evidence types registered. The `init()` function registers the CometBFT crypto, evidence types, and legacy Amino codec with the `Cdc` variable. 

The `PrivKeyFromBytes()` function unmarshals private key bytes and returns a `PrivKey` object. Similarly, the `PubKeyFromBytes()` function unmarshals public key bytes and returns a `PubKey` object. These functions use the `Cdc` variable to unmarshal the bytes into the appropriate key object.

Overall, this file provides a way to register and use a global codec variable that can be used throughout the cosmos-sdk project to encode and decode various types of data. The `PrivKeyFromBytes()` and `PubKeyFromBytes()` functions provide a way to unmarshal private and public key bytes into their respective key objects. 

Example usage of `PrivKeyFromBytes()` and `PubKeyFromBytes()` functions:
```
privKeyBytes := []byte{...} // bytes representing a private key
pubKeyBytes := []byte{...} // bytes representing a public key

privKey, err := PrivKeyFromBytes(privKeyBytes)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

pubKey, err := PubKeyFromBytes(pubKeyBytes)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Cdc` variable and why is it marked as deprecated?
- The `Cdc` variable is a global generic sealed Amino codec used throughout the sdk, with all CometBFT crypto and evidence types registered. It is marked as deprecated and should be removed.

2. What is the `init()` function doing in this file?
- The `init()` function registers the CometBFT crypto, evidence types, and legacy Amino codec with the `Cdc` variable.

3. What are the `PrivKeyFromBytes()` and `PubKeyFromBytes()` functions used for?
- These functions unmarshal private and public key bytes respectively and return a `cryptotypes.PrivKey` or `cryptotypes.PubKey`.
