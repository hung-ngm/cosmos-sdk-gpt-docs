The `telemetry` package provides functionality for emitting metrics related to the Cosmos SDK. The package contains several functions that wrap around the `go-metrics` library to provide a shorthand for emitting metrics with global labels.

The `const` block defines some common metric key constants that are used throughout the package. The `MetricKeyBeginBlocker` and `MetricKeyEndBlocker` constants are used to track the time taken by the `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock` methods of the `App` struct, respectively. The `MetricLabelNameModule` constant is used to define the label name for the module associated with a metric.

The `NewLabel` function creates a new instance of the `Label` struct with the given name and value. This function is used to create a label for the module associated with a metric.

The `ModuleMeasureSince` function provides a shorthand for emitting a time measure metric for a module with a given set of keys. The function takes the name of the module, the start time, and a list of keys as arguments. If any global labels are defined, they will be added to the module label. This function is used to track the time taken by the `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock` methods of the `App` struct.

The `ModuleSetGauge` function provides a shorthand for emitting a gauge metric for a module with a given set of keys. The function takes the name of the module, the value of the gauge, and a list of keys as arguments. If any global labels are defined, they will be added to the module label. This function is used to track the number of transactions in the mempool.

The `IncrCounter` function provides a wrapper functionality for emitting a counter metric with global labels (if any). The function takes the value of the counter and a list of keys as arguments. This function is used to track the number of transactions processed by the `DeliverTx` method of the `App` struct.

The `IncrCounterWithLabels` function provides a wrapper functionality for emitting a counter metric with global labels (if any) along with the provided labels. The function takes the value of the counter, a list of keys, and a list of labels as arguments. This function is used to track the number of errors encountered by the `DeliverTx` method of the `App` struct.

The `SetGauge` function provides a wrapper functionality for emitting a gauge metric with global labels (if any). The function takes the value of the gauge and a list of keys as arguments. This function is used to track the number of transactions in the mempool.

The `SetGaugeWithLabels` function provides a wrapper functionality for emitting a gauge metric with global labels (if any) along with the provided labels. The function takes the value of the gauge, a list of keys, and a list of labels as arguments. This function is used to track the size of the mempool.

The `MeasureSince` function provides a wrapper functionality for emitting a time measure metric with global labels (if any). The function takes the start time and a list of keys as arguments. This function is used to track the time taken by the `DeliverTx` method of the `App` struct.

Overall, the `telemetry` package provides a convenient way to emit metrics related to the Cosmos SDK. The package is used extensively throughout the SDK to track the performance and health of the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `telemetry` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project?
- The `telemetry` package provides functionality for emitting metrics for a module with a given set of keys.

2. What are the global labels used in the `IncrCounterWithLabels`, `SetGaugeWithLabels`, and `MeasureSince` functions?
- The global labels are appended to the provided labels and are used for emitting metrics with global labels.

3. What is the difference between the `ModuleMeasureSince` and `MeasureSince` functions?
- The `ModuleMeasureSince` function provides a shorthand method for emitting a time measure metric for a module with a given set of keys, while the `MeasureSince` function provides a wrapper functionality for emitting a time measure metric with global labels (if any).
