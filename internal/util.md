The `util` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains a function called `CombineErrors`. This function takes in three parameters: `ret`, `also`, and `desc`. `ret` is an error that may already exist, `also` is an additional error that may be encountered, and `desc` is a string that describes the error.

The purpose of this function is to combine multiple errors into a single error message. If `also` is not nil, it means that an additional error has occurred. In this case, the function checks if `ret` is also not nil. If both `ret` and `also` are not nil, the function creates a new error message that combines the two errors and the description string. If `ret` is nil, the function simply returns `also`. If `also` is nil, the function returns `ret`.

This function can be used in the larger project to handle errors that may occur in different parts of the code. By combining multiple errors into a single error message, it makes it easier to understand what went wrong and where the error occurred. Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
func myFunction() error {
    err1 := someOperation()
    err2 := anotherOperation()
    err := util.CombineErrors(err1, err2, "Error in myFunction")
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    // continue with function logic
}
```

In this example, `myFunction` calls two different operations that may return errors. The `CombineErrors` function is used to combine these errors into a single error message with the description "Error in myFunction". If there is an error, it is returned from the function. If there are no errors, the function continues with its logic.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CombineErrors` function?
- The `CombineErrors` function is used to combine two errors into a single error message with a description.

2. What parameters does the `CombineErrors` function take?
- The `CombineErrors` function takes three parameters: `ret` (an error), `also` (an error), and `desc` (a string).

3. What does the `%w` verb in the `fmt.Errorf` call do?
- The `%w` verb in the `fmt.Errorf` call is used to wrap an error with another error, allowing for more detailed error messages.
