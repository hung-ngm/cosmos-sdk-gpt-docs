The code defines functions for registering and managing streaming services in the BaseApp of the cosmos-sdk project. The `RegisterStreamingServices` function registers streaming services with the BaseApp. It takes in the app options and a map of key-value store keys as parameters. It reads the streaming configuration from the app options and registers the streaming plugin with the BaseApp if the plugin name is provided in the configuration. The function calls the `registerStreamingPlugin` function to register the plugin.

The `registerStreamingPlugin` function registers the streaming plugin with the BaseApp. It takes in the app options, a map of key-value store keys, and the streaming plugin as parameters. The function checks if the streaming plugin implements the `ABCIListener` interface and registers the plugin with the BaseApp by calling the `registerABCIListenerPlugin` function.

The `registerABCIListenerPlugin` function registers plugins that implement the `ABCIListener` interface with the BaseApp. It takes in the app options, a map of key-value store keys, and the `ABCIListener` plugin as parameters. The function reads the streaming configuration from the app options and sets the streaming manager with the `ABCIListener` plugin and the stop node on error flag. The function also adds the exposed store keys to the BaseApp.

The `exposeStoreKeysSorted` function sorts the store keys for deterministic output. It takes in a list of store keys as strings and a map of key-value store keys as parameters. The function checks if all store keys are to be exposed and returns all store keys if true. Otherwise, it returns the store keys that are to be exposed in sorted order.

Overall, these functions provide the functionality to register and manage streaming services in the BaseApp of the cosmos-sdk project. Developers can use these functions to add streaming services to their applications and customize the streaming configuration. Below is an example of how to use the `RegisterStreamingServices` function:

```
app := NewBaseApp(name, logger, db, nil)
keys := map[string]*storetypes.KVStoreKey{
    "key1": storetypes.NewKVStoreKey("key1", storetypes.StoreTypeIAVL),
    "key2": storetypes.NewKVStoreKey("key2", storetypes.StoreTypeIAVL),
}
appOpts := servertypes.AppOptions{
    StreamingTomlKey: map[string]interface{}{
        "service1": map[string]interface{}{
            "plugin": "plugin1",
        },
    },
}
err := app.RegisterStreamingServices(appOpts, keys)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RegisterStreamingServices` function?
- The `RegisterStreamingServices` function registers streaming services with the `BaseApp` and takes in application options and a map of key-value store keys as parameters.

2. What is the `registerABCIListenerPlugin` function used for?
- The `registerABCIListenerPlugin` function registers plugins that implement the `ABCIListener` interface and sets the streaming manager with the given `ABCIListener` and `stopNodeOnErr` parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `exposeStoreKeysSorted` function?
- The `exposeStoreKeysSorted` function takes in a list of store keys and a map of key-value store keys, and returns a sorted list of store keys to be exposed.
