The code defines two methods for registering gRPC services with the gRPC server in the context of a BaseApp. The `GRPCQueryRouter` method returns the `GRPCQueryRouter` of a BaseApp, while the `RegisterGRPCServer` method registers gRPC services directly with the gRPC server.

The `RegisterGRPCServer` method defines an interceptor for all gRPC queries. This interceptor creates a new `sdk.Context` and passes it into the query handler. If there is metadata in the context, it retrieves it. It then gets the height header from the request context, if present. If the height header is present, it creates the `sdk.Context` and attaches it to the gRPC's `context.Context`. It also adds relevant gRPC headers. If the height was not set in the request, it sets it to the latest. The method then loops through all services and methods, adds the interceptor, and registers the service.

This code is used in the larger project to register gRPC services with the gRPC server in the context of a BaseApp. It provides an interceptor for all gRPC queries, which creates a new `sdk.Context` and passes it into the query handler. This allows for the creation of a new `sdk.Context` for each gRPC query, which can be used to handle the query. The `RegisterGRPCServer` method is called when registering gRPC services with the gRPC server. An example of how to use this method is shown below:

```
app := NewBaseApp(...)
server := gogogrpc.NewServer()
app.RegisterGRPCServer(server)
```

This code creates a new `BaseApp` and a new gRPC server. It then registers the gRPC server with the `BaseApp` using the `RegisterGRPCServer` method. This allows the gRPC server to handle gRPC queries in the context of the `BaseApp`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RegisterGRPCServer` function?
- The `RegisterGRPCServer` function registers gRPC services directly with the gRPC server and adds an interceptor for all gRPC queries.

2. What is the `GRPCQueryRouter` function used for?
- The `GRPCQueryRouter` function returns the `GRPCQueryRouter` of a `BaseApp`.

3. What is the purpose of the `interceptor` function?
- The `interceptor` function creates a new `sdk.Context` and passes it into the query handler, and adds relevant gRPC headers.
