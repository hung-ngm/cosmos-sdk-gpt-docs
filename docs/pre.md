This script is responsible for generating and organizing documentation for the cosmos-sdk project. It creates pages for each module in the project by iterating through the directories in the `../x/` directory and copying the `README.md` file from each module to a corresponding directory in `docs/modules/`. It also includes vesting and transaction modules from the `auth` submodule in the `docs/modules/auth/` directory. 

The script then adds pages for tooling, packages, Rosetta, architecture, spec, RFC, and SDK migration documentation. It copies the `README.md` file from each tool, package, or documentation directory to a corresponding file in the `docs/` directory. 

This script is useful for keeping the documentation organized and up-to-date as the project evolves. It allows developers to easily navigate and understand the different modules, tools, and packages in the project. 

Example usage:
```
./generate-docs.sh
```
This command will run the script and generate the documentation pages in the `docs/` directory.
