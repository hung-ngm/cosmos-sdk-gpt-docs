This code defines font families and their corresponding font files for use in the cosmos-sdk project. The font families defined in this file are Inter and JetBrains Mono. 

For each font family, there are multiple variations defined with different font weights and styles. For example, the Inter font family has variations for normal, medium, bold, and black font weights. Each variation has a font-display property set to "swap", which means that the font will be displayed immediately, even if it is still being downloaded. This ensures that the user sees text displayed in the correct font as soon as possible.

The font files for each variation are defined using the @font-face rule. The src property specifies the location of the font file, which is in the "~/static/fonts" directory. The format property specifies the format of the font file, which is either "woff2" or "woff". 

This code is important for ensuring that the cosmos-sdk project has a consistent and visually appealing typography. By defining font families and their variations, developers can easily use these fonts throughout the project without having to manually specify the font file for each variation. For example, a developer can simply use the "Inter" font family in their CSS code and the correct font file will be automatically loaded based on the font weight and style specified.

Here is an example of how a developer might use the Inter font family in their CSS code:

```
body {
  font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

This code sets the font family to "Inter" with a font weight of 400 and a font size of 16 pixels. The correct font file for the Inter-Regular variation will be automatically loaded based on the @font-face rules defined in this file.
