This code is a bash script that is used to clean up the documentation files for the cosmos-sdk project. The purpose of this script is to remove unnecessary or outdated documentation files that are no longer needed in the project. 

The script uses the `find` command to search for files in the `docs/modules` directory that are not named `_category_.json` and are of type `f` (file). It then executes the `rm -rf` command to remove these files. This command recursively removes the files and directories specified, including any subdirectories and their contents. 

The script also removes specific files such as `01-cosmovisor.md`, `02-confix.md`, `03-hubl.md`, `01-depinject.md`, `02-collections.md`, `03-orm.md`, and `04-rosetta.md` from the `docs/tooling` and `docs/packages` directories. These files may have been outdated or no longer relevant to the project. 

Additionally, the script removes the `docs/architecture`, `docs/spec`, `docs/rfc`, `docs/migrations/02-upgrading.md`, `versioned_docs`, `versioned_sidebars`, and `versions.json` directories and files. These directories and files may have been outdated or no longer relevant to the project. 

Overall, this script helps to keep the documentation for the cosmos-sdk project clean and up-to-date by removing unnecessary or outdated files. It can be used as part of a larger documentation management system to ensure that the project's documentation remains organized and relevant. 

Example usage:

```
./cleanup_docs.sh
```

This command would execute the `cleanup_docs.sh` script and remove the specified files and directories from the cosmos-sdk documentation.
