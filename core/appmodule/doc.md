The `appmodule` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project defines the functionality for registering app modules that are assembled using the `cosmossdk.io/depinject` dependency injection system and the declarative app configuration format handled by the `appconfig` package. 

In other words, this package provides a way to register app modules in the `cosmos-sdk` project using a dependency injection system and a declarative configuration format. This allows for easier management and organization of app modules within the project.

For example, a developer could use this package to register a custom app module that provides additional functionality to the `cosmos-sdk` project. They would define the module using the dependency injection system and declarative configuration format, and then register it using the methods provided by this package.

Overall, the `appmodule` package plays an important role in the larger `cosmos-sdk` project by providing a standardized way to register and manage app modules.
