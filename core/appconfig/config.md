The `appconfig` package provides functionality for loading and composing application configurations for the Cosmos SDK project. The package contains functions for loading app configurations in JSON and YAML formats, as well as a function for composing a v1alpha1 app config into a container option by resolving the required modules and composing their options.

The `LoadJSON` function takes a byte slice of JSON data and unmarshals it into a `Config` struct defined in the `appv1alpha1` package. If the unmarshaling fails, it returns an error wrapped in a `depinject.Config` object. The `LoadYAML` function takes a byte slice of YAML data, converts it to JSON, and then calls `LoadJSON` to unmarshal the JSON data. Both functions return a `depinject.Config` object that can be used to configure a dependency injection container.

The `WrapAny` function takes a `protoreflect.ProtoMessage` and marshals it into a `proto.Any` instance. This is useful for passing messages of unknown type between services.

The `Compose` function takes a `Config` struct and composes it into a container option by resolving the required modules and composing their options. It first supplies the `Config` struct to the container, then iterates over the `Modules` slice of the `Config` struct. For each module, it checks that it has a name and a config object, then finds the corresponding protobuf message type using its type URL. It then looks up the module initializer for that message type and supplies its config object to the container. It also provides any providers and invokers defined by the module, as well as any Golang bindings. Finally, it adds any Golang bindings defined at the app level.

The `dumpRegisteredModules` function is a helper function that returns a string listing all the registered modules in the internal module registry.

Overall, this package provides essential functionality for loading and composing app configurations in the Cosmos SDK project. It allows for flexible configuration of the dependency injection container, making it easy to add and remove modules as needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LoadJSON` and `LoadYAML` functions?
- The `LoadJSON` function loads an app config in JSON format and returns a `depinject.Config` object. The `LoadYAML` function loads an app config in YAML format, converts it to JSON, and returns a `depinject.Config` object.
2. What does the `Compose` function do?
- The `Compose` function composes a v1alpha1 app config into a container option by resolving the required modules and composing their options. It returns a `depinject.Config` object.
3. What is the purpose of the `WrapAny` function?
- The `WrapAny` function marshals a proto message into a proto Any instance and returns it.
