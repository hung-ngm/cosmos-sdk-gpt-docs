The `address` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains an interface called `Codec` that is used to convert addresses from and to string/bytes. This interface defines two methods: `StringToBytes` and `BytesToString`.

The `StringToBytes` method takes a string as input and returns a byte slice. This method is used to decode a string representation of an address into its corresponding byte representation. For example, if we have a string representation of an address like `"cosmos1qperwt9wrnkg5k9e5gzfgjppzpqhyav5j24d66"`, we can use the `StringToBytes` method to convert it to its byte representation.

The `BytesToString` method takes a byte slice as input and returns a string. This method is used to encode a byte representation of an address into its corresponding string representation. For example, if we have a byte representation of an address like `[99 111 115 109 111 115 49 113 112 101 114 119 116 57 119 114 110 107 103 53 107 57 101 53 103 122 102 103 106 112 112 122 112 113 104 121 97 118 53 106 50 52 100 54 54]`, we can use the `BytesToString` method to convert it to its string representation.

This interface is used throughout the `cosmos-sdk` project to convert addresses between their string and byte representations. For example, when sending a transaction, the sender's address needs to be converted to its byte representation before it can be included in the transaction. Similarly, when querying the blockchain for information about an account, the account's address needs to be converted to its string representation before it can be used in the query.

Here is an example of how this interface might be used in the `cosmos-sdk` project:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/address"
)

func main() {
	// create a new codec
	var codec address.Codec = address.NewBech32Codec()

	// convert an address from string to bytes
	addrStr := "cosmos1qperwt9wrnkg5k9e5gzfgjppzpqhyav5j24d66"
	addrBytes, err := codec.StringToBytes(addrStr)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// convert an address from bytes to string
	addrBytes = []byte{99, 111, 115, 109, 111, 115, 49, 113, 112, 101, 114, 119, 116, 57, 119, 114, 110, 107, 103, 53, 107, 57, 101, 53, 103, 122, 102, 103, 106, 112, 112, 122, 112, 113, 104, 121, 97, 118, 53, 106, 50, 52, 100, 54, 54}
	addrStr, err = codec.BytesToString(addrBytes)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(addrStr)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this package and interface?** 
The package `address` defines an interface called `Codec` which is used to convert addresses from and to string/bytes. 

2. **What methods are included in the `Codec` interface?** 
The `Codec` interface includes two methods: `StringToBytes` which decodes text to bytes, and `BytesToString` which encodes bytes to text.

3. **What potential errors could occur when using these methods?** 
Both `StringToBytes` and `BytesToString` methods return an error, so a smart developer might want to know what types of errors could occur and how to handle them.
