The `event` package provides a basic API for app modules to emit events. The package contains two main interfaces: `Service` and `Manager`. The `Service` interface represents an event service that can retrieve and set an event manager in a context. The `Manager` interface represents an event manager that can emit events.

The `Manager` interface has three methods: `Emit`, `EmitKV`, and `EmitNonConsensus`. The `Emit` method emits events represented as a protobuf message. Callers should assume that these events may be included in consensus. These events must be emitted deterministically, and adding, removing, or changing these events should be considered a state-machine breaking change. The `EmitKV` method emits an event based on an event and kv-pair attributes. These events will not be part of consensus, and adding, removing, or changing these events is not a state-machine breaking change. The `EmitNonConsensus` method emits events represented as a protobuf message without including it in blockchain consensus. These events will not be part of consensus, and adding, removing, or changing events is not a state-machine breaking change.

The `Attribute` struct represents a kv-pair event attribute. It has two fields: `Key` and `Value`. The `Key` field represents the key of the kv-pair, and the `Value` field represents the value of the kv-pair.

This package is an essential part of the cosmos-sdk project as it provides a way for app modules to emit events. These events can be used to notify other modules of changes in the state of the application. For example, a module that manages user accounts can emit an event when a new account is created. Other modules can listen to these events and take appropriate actions. The `event` package provides a standard way for modules to emit events, ensuring consistency and compatibility across the entire cosmos-sdk project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this package and what problem does it solve?
- This package provides a basic API for app modules to emit events. It allows modules to retrieve and set an event manager in a context, and emit events represented as a protobuf message.

2. What is the difference between Emit, EmitKV, and EmitNonConsensus methods?
- Emit method emits events represented as a protobuf message and these events may be included in consensus. Adding, removing or changing these events should be considered state-machine breaking. EmitKV method emits an event based on an event and kv-pair attributes, which will not be part of consensus and changing these events is not a state-machine breaking change. EmitNonConsensus method emits events represented as a protobuf message, without including it in blockchain consensus, and changing events is not a state-machine breaking change.

3. How should developers use this package in their code?
- Developers should implement the Service interface to provide an event manager for their app modules. They can then use the Manager interface to emit events in their modules, either as protobuf messages or kv-pair attributes. They should be aware of the differences between the Emit, EmitKV, and EmitNonConsensus methods and use them appropriately based on their needs.
