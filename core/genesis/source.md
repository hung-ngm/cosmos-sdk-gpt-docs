The `genesis` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project contains code related to the initialization of a new blockchain network. This particular file contains a function called `SourceFromRawJSON` that returns a `GenesisSource` interface and an error. 

The purpose of this function is to create a genesis source based on a raw JSON message. The `GenesisSource` interface is defined in the `appmodule` package and is used to provide access to the genesis data for the blockchain network. 

The `SourceFromRawJSON` function takes a `json.RawMessage` as input and returns a function that takes a `field` string as input and returns an `io.ReadCloser` and an error. The `json.RawMessage` is unmarshalled into a map of `string` to `json.RawMessage`. The returned function checks if the `field` string exists in the map and if it does, it returns a `readCloserWrapper` that wraps the `bytes.NewReader` of the `json.RawMessage`. If the `field` string does not exist in the map, it returns `nil` for both the `io.ReadCloser` and the error.

This function can be used in the larger project to initialize a new blockchain network by providing the genesis data in a raw JSON format. The `SourceFromRawJSON` function can be called with the raw JSON message as input and the returned `GenesisSource` interface can be used to provide access to the genesis data for the blockchain network. 

Example usage:

```
rawJSON := []byte(`{"field1": "value1", "field2": "value2"}`)
genesisSource, err := SourceFromRawJSON(rawJSON)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
field1Reader, err := genesisSource("field1")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
defer field1Reader.Close()
// use field1Reader to access the genesis data for "field1"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall cosmos-sdk project?
- This code provides a function called `SourceFromRawJSON` that returns a genesis source based on a raw JSON message. It is part of the `genesis` package in the cosmos-sdk project.

2. What is the `appmodule` package and how is it used in this code?
- The `appmodule` package is imported and used to define the `GenesisSource` type that is returned by the `SourceFromRawJSON` function.

3. What is the purpose of the `readCloserWrapper` type and how is it used in this code?
- The `readCloserWrapper` type is used to wrap a `bytes.Reader` and implement the `io.ReadCloser` interface. It is used to return an `io.ReadCloser` from the `SourceFromRawJSON` function.
