This code defines the client and server API for the `Msg` service in the `cosmos.gov.v1beta1` package. The `Msg` service provides methods for submitting proposals, voting on proposals, adding weighted votes on proposals, and adding deposits on proposals. 

The `MsgClient` interface defines the client-side API for the `Msg` service. It includes four methods: `SubmitProposal`, `Vote`, `VoteWeighted`, and `Deposit`. These methods take a context, a message, and optional gRPC call options, and return a response message and an error. 

The `msgClient` struct implements the `MsgClient` interface. It has a `cc` field of type `grpc.ClientConnInterface` that represents the client connection. The `NewMsgClient` function creates a new `msgClient` instance with the given client connection. 

The `MsgServer` interface defines the server-side API for the `Msg` service. It includes the same four methods as the `MsgClient` interface. These methods take a context and a message, and return a response message and an error. 

The `UnimplementedMsgServer` struct is a default implementation of the `MsgServer` interface that returns an error for each method. It is intended to be embedded in other structs that implement the `MsgServer` interface, to provide forward compatibility for future versions of the `Msg` service. 

The `RegisterMsgServer` function registers the `MsgServer` implementation with the gRPC service registrar. 

The `Msg_ServiceDesc` struct is a gRPC service descriptor for the `Msg` service. It includes the service name, the handler type, and an array of method descriptors. Each method descriptor includes the method name and a handler function that takes the server implementation, a context, a message, and an interceptor function, and returns a response message and an error. 

Overall, this code provides a standardized API for interacting with the `Msg` service in the `cosmos.gov.v1beta1` package. It can be used by client applications to submit proposals, vote on proposals, add weighted votes on proposals, and add deposits on proposals, and by server applications to implement these methods.
