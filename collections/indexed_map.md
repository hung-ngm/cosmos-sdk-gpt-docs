The code defines a collection of data structures and functions that allow for the creation and management of an indexed map. The indexed map is a partitioned collection that maintains a map of objects and a set of indexes that are used to create relationships between fields of the objects and their primary keys. The indexes are grouped together in an Indexes interface, which is implemented by the Index type. The Index type represents an index of the Value indexed using the type PrimaryKey. 

The IndexedMap type is the main data structure that is used to create and manage the indexed map. It is created by calling the NewIndexedMap function, which takes a SchemaBuilder, a Prefix, a humanized name that defines the name of the collection, the primary key codec, the value codec, and the initialized indexes. The IndexedMap type has methods that allow for getting, iterating, checking for the existence of, setting, and removing values from the map. 

The ref and unref functions are used to add and remove references to the indexes when a value is added or removed from the map. The cachedGet function is used to return a function that gets the value V, given the key K but returns always the same result on multiple calls. 

Overall, this code provides a way to create and manage an indexed map that allows for efficient querying and searching of data. It is a useful tool for managing large sets of data and creating relationships between different fields of the data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Indexes` and `Index` interfaces?
- The `Indexes` interface groups multiple `Index` of one `Value` saved with the provided `PrimaryKey`, while the `Index` interface represents an index of the `Value` indexed using the type `PrimaryKey`.

2. How does `IndexedMap` differ from a regular `Map`?
- `IndexedMap` creates references between fields of `Value` and its `PrimaryKey`, and maintains these relationships using the `Indexes` type. It can be seen as a partitioned collection, with one partition being a `Map[PrimaryKey, Value]` that maintains the object, and the second being the `Indexes`.

3. What is the purpose of the `cachedGet` function?
- The `cachedGet` function returns a function that gets the value `V`, given the key `K`, but returns always the same result on multiple calls. It is used to fetch the previous old value when creating or removing a reference between the primary key and value.
