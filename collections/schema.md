The `collections` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project provides a way to group collections of data stored in a single key-value store. The `SchemaBuilder` struct is used to build a schema for the collections. The `NewSchemaBuilderFromAccessor` function creates a new schema builder from a store accessor function. The `NewSchemaBuilder` function creates a new schema builder from a store key. The `Build` method should be called after all collections have been initialized to get a reference to the schema. The `SchemaBuilder` cannot be used after `Build` is called. The `Schema` struct specifies a group of collections stored within the storage specified by a single store key. All the collections within the schema must have a unique binary prefix and human-readable name. The `NewSchema` function creates a new schema for the provided `KVStoreService`. The `NewMemoryStoreSchema` function creates a new schema for the provided `MemoryStoreService`. The `NewSchemaFromAccessor` function creates a new schema for the provided store accessor function. The `DefaultGenesis`, `ValidateGenesis`, `InitGenesis`, and `ExportGenesis` methods are used for importing/exporting genesis data and for schema reflection for clients. The `getCollection` method returns a collection by name. The `addCollection` method adds a collection to the schema builder. The `appendError` method appends an error to the schema builder's error. The `NameRegex` constant is the regular expression that all valid collection names must match. The `nameRegex` variable is a compiled regular expression for the `NameRegex` constant.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SchemaBuilder` struct and its associated methods?
- The `SchemaBuilder` struct is used for building schemas for a group of collections stored within a storage specified by a single store key. Its methods are used for adding collections to the schema, checking for overlapping prefixes, and building the final schema.

2. What is the purpose of the `Schema` struct and its associated methods?
- The `Schema` struct represents a group of collections stored within a storage specified by a single store key. Its methods are used for creating, validating, initializing, and exporting genesis data for the collections within the schema.

3. What is the purpose of the `NameRegex` constant and the `nameRegex` variable?
- The `NameRegex` constant is a regular expression that all valid collection names must match. The `nameRegex` variable is a compiled regular expression that is used to check if a collection name matches the required format.
