This code defines two key codecs, `int64Key` and `int32Key`, which are used to encode and decode integer keys for use in the larger cosmos-sdk project. These codecs implement the `KeyCodec` interface, which specifies methods for encoding, decoding, and manipulating keys.

The `int64Key` codec encodes and decodes 64-bit integer keys. The `Encode` method takes a buffer and a key, and encodes the key as a big-endian byte slice. The most significant bit of the first byte is then flipped to indicate that the key is negative. The `Decode` method takes a byte slice and decodes it back into a 64-bit integer key. The `Size` method returns the size of the encoded key in bytes, which is always 8 for 64-bit integers. The `EncodeJSON` and `DecodeJSON` methods encode and decode keys as JSON strings, respectively. The `Stringify` method returns a string representation of the key, and the `KeyType` method returns the type of the key as a string. The `EncodeNonTerminal`, `DecodeNonTerminal`, and `SizeNonTerminal` methods are used for encoding and decoding non-terminal keys in a tree structure.

The `int32Key` codec is similar to the `int64Key` codec, but encodes and decodes 32-bit integer keys instead. The methods are the same as those in the `int64Key` codec, but the `Size` method returns 4 instead of 8.

These key codecs are used throughout the cosmos-sdk project to encode and decode integer keys for use in various data structures, such as Merkle trees and key-value stores. For example, the `int64Key` codec is used in the `store` package to encode and decode keys for the `KVStore` interface. The `int32Key` codec is used in the `iavl` package to encode and decode keys for the `IAVLTree` interface. By providing a standard interface for encoding and decoding integer keys, these codecs make it easier to work with different data structures and storage backends in the cosmos-sdk project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines key codecs for encoding and decoding int64 and int32 keys.

2. What is the significance of the XOR operation in the Encode functions?
- The XOR operation with 0x80 is used to ensure that the most significant bit of the encoded key is set to 1, which is necessary for proper lexicographic ordering of keys.

3. What is the difference between the Encode and EncodeNonTerminal functions?
- The Encode function is used for encoding keys that are terminal nodes in a tree structure, while the EncodeNonTerminal function is used for encoding keys that are non-terminal nodes. The difference is in the way the encoded keys are treated during lexicographic ordering.
