The `indexes` package contains an implementation of an index called `ReversePair`. This index is used with `collections.Pair` keys and indexes objects by their second part of the key. When the value is being indexed by `collections.IndexedMap`, then `ReversePair` will create a relationship between the second part of the primary key and the first part. 

The `ReversePair` index is implemented as a struct with a `refKeys` field that has the relationships between `Join(K2, K1)`. The `NewReversePair` function instantiates a new `ReversePair` index. It takes a `SchemaBuilder`, a `Prefix`, a `name`, and a `pairCodec` as input parameters. The `pairCodec` is an interface to cast a `collections.KeyCodec` to a pair codec. The function returns a pointer to a `ReversePair` index. 

The `Iterate` function exposes the raw iterator API. It takes a `context.Context` and a `collections.Ranger` as input parameters and returns a `ReversePairIterator`. The `MatchExact` function returns an iterator containing only the primary keys starting with the provided second part of the multipart pair key. It takes a `context.Context` and a `key` as input parameters and returns a `ReversePairIterator`. 

The `Reference` and `Unreference` functions implement `collections.Index`. The `Walk` function takes a `context.Context`, a `collections.Ranger`, and a `walkFunc` as input parameters and returns an error. The `IterateRaw` function takes a `context.Context`, a `start`, an `end`, and an `order` as input parameters and returns an iterator. The `KeyCodec` function returns a `collections.KeyCodec`. 

The `ReversePairIterator` is a helper type around a `collections.KeySetIterator` when used to work with `ReversePair` indexes iterations. The `PrimaryKey` function returns the primary key from the index. The `PrimaryKeys` function returns all the primary keys contained in the iterator. The `FullKey`, `Next`, `Valid`, and `Close` functions are used to iterate over the index. 

In summary, the `ReversePair` index is used to index objects by their second part of the key. It creates a relationship between the second part of the primary key and the first part. The `indexes` package provides functions to instantiate, iterate, and manipulate the `ReversePair` index. It also provides a helper type to work with `ReversePair` indexes iterations.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the ReversePair index and how is it used?
- The ReversePair index is used to index objects by their second part of the key, and it creates a relationship between the second part of the primary key and the first part. It is used to match exact keys, reference and unreference keys, and iterate over keys.

2. What is the purpose of the `pairKeyCodec` interface and why is it used?
- The `pairKeyCodec` interface is used to cast a `collections.KeyCodec` to a pair codec. It is used to improve the developer experience with type inference, but it means that the concrete implementation which exposes `KeyCodec1` and `KeyCodec2` cannot be obtained.

3. How can a developer instantiate a new ReversePair index and what type hinting is required?
- A developer can instantiate a new ReversePair index using the `NewReversePair` function, which requires a schema builder, a prefix, a name, and a pair codec. Type hinting is required when using this function, and the type hint should be the value of the indexed map (e.g. `string`) followed by the types of the two parts of the key (e.g. `K1` and `K2`).
