The `indexes` package contains a set of helper functions for working with indexed maps. The `iterator` interface defines the minimum set of methods required to work with the helpers. The `CollectKeyValues` function collects all the keys and values of an indexed map index iterator. The iterator is fully consumed and closed. The `ScanKeyValues` function calls the `do` function on every record found in the indexed map from the index iterator. Returning true stops the iteration. The iterator is closed when this function exits. The `CollectValues` function collects all the values from an index iterator and the indexed map. The iterator is closed. The `ScanValues` function collects all the values from an index iterator and the indexed map in a lazy way. The iterator is closed when this function exits.

These functions are useful for working with indexed maps in a more efficient way. They allow for the collection of all keys and values or just values from an index iterator and the indexed map. The `ScanKeyValues` and `ScanValues` functions are useful for iterating over the indexed map in a lazy way, which can be more efficient than collecting all the keys and values upfront. The `CollectKeyValues` and `CollectValues` functions are useful when all the keys and values or just values are needed upfront.

Example usage of these functions can be seen in the `cosmos-sdk` project where indexed maps are used extensively. For example, in the `staking` module, the `ValidatorsByPowerIndex` is an indexed map that maps validator power to validator addresses. The `ScanValues` function can be used to iterate over the validator addresses in a lazy way. The `CollectKeyValues` function can be used to collect all the validator power and address pairs upfront. These functions make working with indexed maps more efficient and easier to use.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `collections` package imported in this file?
- The `collections` package is used to define the types of indexes and key-value pairs used in the functions defined in this file.

2. What is the difference between `CollectKeyValues` and `CollectValues` functions?
- `CollectKeyValues` collects both the keys and values of an indexed map index iterator, while `CollectValues` only collects the values.

3. What is the purpose of the `iterator` interface defined in this file?
- The `iterator` interface defines the minimum set of methods required for an index iterator to work with the helper functions in this file.
