The `indexes` package contains an implementation of a unique index that imposes uniqueness constraints on the reference key. The `Unique` type creates relationships between reference and primary keys of the value. This index is used to ensure that a certain field in a data structure is unique across all instances of that data structure. 

The `Unique` type has several methods that allow for the manipulation of the index. The `NewUnique` function instantiates a new `Unique` index. It takes in a `SchemaBuilder`, a `Prefix`, a name, a `KeyCodec` for the reference key, a `KeyCodec` for the primary key, and a function that returns the reference key given the primary key and value. 

The `Reference` method adds a new value to the index. It takes in a context, a primary key, a new value, and a function that returns the old value. If the old value exists, the method removes the old indexes. If the old value does not exist, the method does nothing. The method then creates new indexes, asserting no uniqueness constraint violation. If there is a uniqueness constraint violation, the method returns an error.

The `Unreference` method removes a value from the index. It takes in a context, a primary key, and a function that returns the value. The method then removes the index for the given primary key and value.

The `MatchExact` method returns the primary key for a given reference key.

The `Iterate` method returns an iterator over the index. It takes in a context and a `Ranger` for the reference key.

The `Walk` method walks over the index. It takes in a context, a `Ranger` for the reference key, and a function that takes in the indexing key and indexed key.

The `IterateRaw` method returns an iterator over the index, given a start and end byte slice and an order.

The `UniqueIterator` type is an iterator wrapper that exposes only the functionality needed to work with unique keys. It has several methods that allow for the manipulation of the iterator. The `PrimaryKey` method returns the iterator's current primary key. The `PrimaryKeys` method fully consumes the iterator and returns all the primary keys. The `FullKey` method returns the iterator's current full reference key as a `Pair` of reference and primary keys. The `FullKeys` method returns all the full reference keys. The `Next` method moves the iterator to the next key. The `Valid` method returns whether the iterator is valid. The `Close` method closes the iterator.

Overall, the `Unique` type and its methods provide a way to ensure that a certain field in a data structure is unique across all instances of that data structure. This is useful in many contexts, such as ensuring that user IDs are unique across all users in a system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Unique` type and how is it used?
- The `Unique` type is an index that imposes uniqueness constraints on the reference key, creating relationships between reference and primary key of the value. It is used to create and manage indexes for values with unique reference keys.

2. What parameters are required to instantiate a new `Unique` index?
- To instantiate a new `Unique` index, the following parameters are required: a schema builder, a prefix, a name, a reference key codec, a primary key codec, and a function that maps a primary key and value to a reference key.

3. What is the purpose of the `UniqueIterator` type and how is it used?
- The `UniqueIterator` type is an iterator wrapper that exposes only the functionality needed to work with unique keys. It is used to iterate over the primary keys of a `Unique` index and retrieve their associated reference keys.
