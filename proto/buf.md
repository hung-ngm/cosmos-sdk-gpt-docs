This code is a configuration file for the `cosmos-sdk` project. It specifies the version and name of the project, as well as its dependencies on other modules such as `cosmos-proto`, `gogo-proto`, and `googleapis`. 

The `breaking` section indicates that this version of the `cosmos-sdk` may contain breaking changes, and specifies that the `FILE` class should be used instead of any deprecated classes. 

The `lint` section specifies which linters should be used to check the code for errors or style violations. The `DEFAULT` linter checks for general errors, while `COMMENTS` checks for issues with comments. The `FILE_LOWER_SNAKE_CASE` linter enforces the convention of using lower snake case for file names. 

The `except` section lists specific linting rules that should be ignored, such as `UNARY_RPC`, `COMMENT_FIELD`, `SERVICE_SUFFIX`, `PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX`, and `RPC_REQUEST_STANDARD_NAME`. 

Finally, the `ignore` section specifies that any errors related to `tendermint` should be ignored. 

Overall, this configuration file helps ensure that the `cosmos-sdk` project is properly configured and adheres to best practices for code quality and style. 

Example usage of this configuration file:

```
# build the cosmos-sdk project using the specified configuration file
$ buf build -o cosmos-sdk.bin --config cosmos-sdk.yaml
```
