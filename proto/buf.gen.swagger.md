This code is a configuration file for the cosmos-sdk project. Specifically, it is configuring the swagger plugin for the project. 

Swagger is a tool for documenting APIs, and the swagger plugin for cosmos-sdk generates swagger documentation for the project's APIs. The configuration in this file specifies where the generated documentation should be outputted (`../tmp-swagger-gen`), as well as some options for the generation process. 

The `logtostderr` option specifies that log messages should be outputted to the console instead of a file. `fqn_for_swagger_name` specifies that fully qualified names should be used for swagger names, and `simple_operation_ids` specifies that simple operation IDs should be used. 

Overall, this configuration file is an important part of the cosmos-sdk project's documentation process. By generating swagger documentation for the project's APIs, it makes it easier for developers to understand and use the project. 

Example usage:

To generate swagger documentation for the cosmos-sdk project, the following command could be run:

```
cosmos-sdk generate swagger
```

This would use the configuration specified in the `cosmos-sdk.yaml` file to generate swagger documentation for the project's APIs. The generated documentation would be outputted to the directory specified in the configuration file (`../tmp-swagger-gen`).
