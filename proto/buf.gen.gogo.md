This code is a configuration file for the cosmos-sdk project. It specifies the version of the project as "v1" and lists two plugins: "gocosmos" and "grpc-gateway". 

The "gocosmos" plugin is used to generate Go code for the project using the gRPC framework. The "out" option specifies the output directory for the generated code, which in this case is ".." (the parent directory of the current directory). The "opt" option specifies additional options for the plugin, including the use of the "grpc" protocol and the inclusion of the "any.proto" file from the "codec/types" package in the project.

The "grpc-gateway" plugin is used to generate a reverse-proxy server that translates RESTful HTTP/JSON API requests into gRPC calls. The "out" option and "opt" option are similar to those used for the "gocosmos" plugin.

Overall, this configuration file is used to specify the necessary plugins for generating Go code and a reverse-proxy server for the cosmos-sdk project. It allows for easier development and integration of the project with other systems that use RESTful APIs or gRPC protocols. 

Example usage:
```
$ protoc --proto_path=$GOPATH/src:. --gocosmos_out=plugins=grpc,Mgoogle/protobuf/any.proto=github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/codec/types:. path/to/your_service.proto
```
This command generates Go code for the specified proto file using the "gocosmos" plugin with the specified options.
