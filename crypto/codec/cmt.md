This code provides functions for converting between different types of public keys used in the cosmos-sdk and CometBFT (CMT) projects. Specifically, it provides functions for converting between CMT's `cmtprotocrypto.PublicKey` and `cmtcrypto.PubKey` types and the `cryptotypes.PubKey` type used in the cosmos-sdk project. 

The `FromCmtProtoPublicKey` function takes a `cmtprotocrypto.PublicKey` as input and returns a `cryptotypes.PubKey`. It first checks the type of the input key and then creates a new `ed25519.PubKey` or `secp256k1.PubKey` depending on the type of the input key. It then returns the new key along with a `nil` error. 

The `ToCmtProtoPublicKey` function takes a `cryptotypes.PubKey` as input and returns a `cmtprotocrypto.PublicKey`. It first checks the type of the input key and then creates a new `cmtprotocrypto.PublicKey` with either an `Ed25519` or `Secp256K1` field depending on the type of the input key. It then returns the new key along with a `nil` error.

The `FromCmtPubKeyInterface` and `ToCmtPubKeyInterface` functions are similar to the above functions, but they take and return `cmtcrypto.PubKey` types instead of `cmtprotocrypto.PublicKey` types. These functions use the `encoding` package to convert between the `cmtcrypto.PubKey` and `cmtprotocrypto.PublicKey` types.

Finally, there are four deprecated functions that are equivalent to the above functions but with different names. These functions are included for backwards compatibility and should not be used in new code.

Overall, these functions are important for interoperability between the cosmos-sdk and CMT projects. They allow public keys to be converted between the two projects, which is necessary for communication between nodes in a distributed system. Here is an example of how the `FromCmtProtoPublicKey` function might be used:

```
import (
    "github.com/cometbft/cometbft/proto/tendermint/crypto"
    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/crypto/types"
)

// assume we have a cmtproto public key called cmtPk
cosmosPk, err := FromCmtProtoPublicKey(cmtPk)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// now we can use the cosmosPk in the cosmos-sdk project
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains functions for converting between different types of public keys used by the Cosmos SDK and the CometBFT library.

2. What types of public keys are supported by these conversion functions?
- The conversion functions support two types of public keys: Ed25519 and Secp256K1.

3. Why are there deprecated functions included in this file?
- The deprecated functions are included for backwards compatibility and should not be used. Developers should use the non-deprecated functions instead.
