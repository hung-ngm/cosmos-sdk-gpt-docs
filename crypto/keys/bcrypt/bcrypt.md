The code is a modified implementation of the bcrypt adaptive hashing algorithm by Provos and Mazières. The package provides functions to generate and compare bcrypt hashed passwords. The GenerateFromPassword function takes a salt, password, and cost as input and returns the bcrypt hash of the password. The cost parameter is used to determine the computational cost of the hash function. If the cost is less than the minimum allowable cost, the cost is set to the default cost. The CompareHashAndPassword function compares a bcrypt hashed password with its plaintext equivalent. The function returns nil on success and an error on failure. The Cost function returns the hashing cost used to create the given hashed password. The package also defines several error types that can be returned by the functions.

The package is used in the larger project to provide secure password hashing for user authentication. The GenerateFromPassword function can be used to generate a bcrypt hash of a user's password during registration. The hashed password can then be stored in a database. When a user logs in, the CompareHashAndPassword function can be used to compare the bcrypt hash of the entered password with the stored hash. If the hashes match, the user is authenticated. The Cost function can be used to determine the hashing cost of a stored password. If the hashing cost needs to be increased in the future, the function can be used to identify which passwords need to be updated.

Example usage:

```
salt := []byte("$2a$10$0123456789012345678901")
password := []byte("password")
cost := uint32(10)

// Generate bcrypt hash of password
hash, err := GenerateFromPassword(salt, password, cost)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Compare bcrypt hash with plaintext password
err = CompareHashAndPassword(hash, password)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Get hashing cost of bcrypt hash
hashCost, err := Cost(hash)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code implements Provos and Mazières's bcrypt adaptive hashing algorithm.

2. What is the range of allowable cost values in GenerateFromPassword?
- The minimum allowable cost is 4 and the maximum allowable cost is 31.

3. What error is returned from CompareHashAndPassword when a hash is too short to be a bcrypt hash?
- The error returned is ErrHashTooShort.
