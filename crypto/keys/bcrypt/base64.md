This file contains functions for encoding and decoding data using the bcrypt algorithm. The bcrypt algorithm is a password hashing function that is commonly used for secure password storage. The functions in this file use base64 encoding to convert binary data to and from a string format that can be stored or transmitted.

The `base64Encode` function takes a byte slice as input and returns a byte slice that contains the base64-encoded version of the input. The function first creates a new base64 encoding using a custom alphabet that includes the characters used by bcrypt. It then uses this encoding to convert the input to a base64-encoded byte slice. Finally, the function removes any padding characters (i.e. "=") from the end of the output.

Example usage:
```
data := []byte("hello world")
encoded := base64Encode(data)
fmt.Println(string(encoded)) // "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ"
```

The `base64Decode` function takes a base64-encoded byte slice as input and returns the original binary data as a byte slice. The function first adds padding characters to the input if necessary to make its length a multiple of 4. It then creates a new base64 decoding using the same custom alphabet as before. Finally, it uses this decoding to convert the input to a binary byte slice.

Example usage:
```
encoded := []byte("aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ")
decoded, err := base64Decode(encoded)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error decoding:", err)
} else {
    fmt.Println(string(decoded)) // "hello world"
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code provides functions for encoding and decoding byte slices using the bcrypt algorithm and base64 encoding.

2. What is the significance of the `alphabet` constant?
   - The `alphabet` constant is a string that defines the characters used in the base64 encoding. It includes all uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and two special characters.

3. Why is the `numOfEquals` variable calculated in the `base64Decode` function?
   - The `numOfEquals` variable is used to determine how many padding characters ('=') need to be added to the input byte slice to make its length a multiple of 4, which is required for base64 decoding.
