This file is a part of the cosmos-sdk project and contains code related to the secp256k1 cryptographic library. The secp256k1 library is used for generating and verifying digital signatures in the cosmos-sdk project.

The code in this file defines two callback functions that are used to convert internal faults in the secp256k1 library into recoverable Go panics. These callback functions are called by the secp256k1 library when it encounters an error that cannot be handled internally.

The first callback function, `secp256k1GoPanicIllegal`, is called when the secp256k1 library encounters an illegal argument. This function takes a message and a pointer to data as arguments and panics with a message that includes the error message from the secp256k1 library.

The second callback function, `secp256k1GoPanicError`, is called when the secp256k1 library encounters an internal error. This function takes a message and a pointer to data as arguments and panics with a message that includes the error message from the secp256k1 library.

These callback functions are used to ensure that errors in the secp256k1 library are handled gracefully and do not cause the entire cosmos-sdk project to crash. By converting internal faults into recoverable Go panics, the cosmos-sdk project can continue to function even when errors occur in the secp256k1 library.

Example usage of these callback functions can be seen in the cosmos-sdk project's `crypto/secp256k1` package, where they are registered with the secp256k1 library using the `secp256k1_go_set_illegal_callback` and `secp256k1_go_set_error_callback` functions.
