This code is a part of the `recovery` package in the `cosmos-sdk` project. It is a workaround for the `go mod vendor` command. The `go mod vendor` command is used to create a vendor directory that contains all the dependencies of a project. However, it does not include any C files that are required by the project. 

To work around this issue, the `crypto/secp256k1/dummy.go` file includes a reference to this `recovery` package. This package contains only a C file, which is required by the `crypto/secp256k1` package. By including a reference to this package, the `go mod vendor` command includes the C file in the vendor directory.

This code does not have any methods or classes that can be used in the larger project. It is simply a workaround to ensure that the `go mod vendor` command includes all the required files in the vendor directory.

Example usage:

There is no example usage for this code as it does not contain any methods or classes.
