This code is responsible for including header files and defining programs for the recovery module of the cosmos-sdk project. The recovery module is used to recover lost or stolen private keys by using a combination of threshold signatures and social recovery. 

The `include_HEADERS` line includes the `secp256k1_recovery.h` header file, which contains functions for recovering private keys using threshold signatures. The `noinst_HEADERS` lines include header files for the main implementation and tests of the recovery module.

The `if USE_BENCHMARK` statement checks if the benchmark flag is set, and if so, defines a program called `bench_recover`. This program is used to benchmark the performance of the recovery module. The `bench_recover_SOURCES` line specifies the source code file for the benchmark program, and the `bench_recover_LDADD` line specifies the libraries that the program should link against.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the recovery module in the cosmos-sdk project. It ensures that the necessary header files are included and defines a benchmark program for testing the performance of the module. Developers working on the recovery module can use this code as a starting point for their own implementations and tests. 

Example usage:

To run the `bench_recover` program, the benchmark flag must be set when compiling the cosmos-sdk project. This can be done by running the following command:

```
make USE_BENCHMARK=1
```

Once the project is compiled with the benchmark flag, the `bench_recover` program can be run by executing the following command:

```
./bench_recover
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `secp256k1_recovery.h` header file?
   - The `secp256k1_recovery.h` header file is included in the project, but without additional context it is unclear what its purpose is.

2. What is the `recovery` module and what is its functionality?
   - The code includes two header files related to the `recovery` module (`main_impl.h` and `tests_impl.h`), but it is unclear what this module does or what its functionality is.

3. What is the purpose of the `bench_recover` program and how is it used?
   - The code includes a conditional statement that adds the `bench_recover` program if `USE_BENCHMARK` is true, but it is unclear what this program does or how it is used.
