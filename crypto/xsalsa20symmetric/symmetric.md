The `xsalsa20symmetric` package provides functions for symmetric encryption and decryption using the NaCl secretbox algorithm. The package exports two functions, `EncryptSymmetric` and `DecryptSymmetric`, which can be used to encrypt and decrypt data using a shared secret key. 

The `EncryptSymmetric` function takes two arguments, a plaintext byte slice and a secret key byte slice. It returns a ciphertext byte slice that is the result of encrypting the plaintext using the secret key. The secret key must be 32 bytes long, and the ciphertext is (secretbox.Overhead + 24) bytes longer than the plaintext. The function generates a random nonce of length 24 bytes, which is used to encrypt the plaintext. The nonce is prepended to the ciphertext and returned.

The `DecryptSymmetric` function takes two arguments, a ciphertext byte slice and a secret key byte slice. It returns a plaintext byte slice that is the result of decrypting the ciphertext using the secret key. The function first checks that the length of the secret key is 32 bytes and that the length of the ciphertext is greater than the length of the nonce plus the length of the secretbox overhead. If either of these checks fails, an error is returned. The function then extracts the nonce from the ciphertext and uses it to decrypt the ciphertext. If the decryption is successful, the plaintext is returned. If the decryption fails, an error is returned.

The `randBytes` function is a helper function that generates a byte slice of random bytes using the `crypto/rand` package. It takes an integer argument that specifies the number of bytes to generate and returns a byte slice of that length.

Overall, this package provides a simple and secure way to encrypt and decrypt data using a shared secret key. It can be used in the larger project to provide secure communication between different components of the system or to encrypt sensitive data stored on disk or in a database. Here is an example of how to use the `EncryptSymmetric` and `DecryptSymmetric` functions:

```
secretKey := []byte("my-secret-key-12345678901234")
plaintext := []byte("hello world")
ciphertext := EncryptSymmetric(plaintext, secretKey)
decrypted, err := DecryptSymmetric(ciphertext, secretKey)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("decryption failed:", err)
} else {
    fmt.Println("decrypted message:", string(decrypted))
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this package and what problem does it solve?
- This package provides functions for symmetric encryption and decryption using the XSalsa20 stream cipher and the Poly1305 authenticator. It solves the problem of securely encrypting and decrypting data using a shared secret key.

2. What is the expected format of the secret key and how should it be generated?
- The secret key must be 32 bytes long and can be generated using a hash function like Sha256 applied to a passphrase. The function `EncryptSymmetric` and `DecryptSymmetric` will panic if the secret key is not 32 bytes long.

3. What is the difference between the length of the ciphertext and the plaintext?
- The ciphertext produced by `EncryptSymmetric` is (secretbox.Overhead + 24) bytes longer than the plaintext. This is because the XSalsa20 stream cipher requires a 24-byte nonce to be used only once per key, and the Poly1305 authenticator adds a 16-byte tag to ensure integrity of the ciphertext. The function `DecryptSymmetric` checks that the length of the ciphertext is at least nonceLen + secretbox.Overhead bytes long.
